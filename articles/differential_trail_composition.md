# Differential Trail Composition

## Introduction: The Essence of Cryptography and Differential Analysis

The quest for secrecy in communication is as ancient as human conflict itself, yet the mathematical discipline that underpins modern digital security emerged only in the mid-20th century, propelled by the demands of an interconnected world. At the heart of this discipline lies symmetric cryptography, a sophisticated dance of algorithms where a shared secret key both locks and unlocks information. Block ciphers, the workhorses of this domain, operate on fixed-length chunks of data (blocks), transforming intelligible plaintext into seemingly random ciphertext through a series of intricate, reversible operations repeated over multiple rounds. The core challenge these ciphers face, known as the *Symmetric Cipher Conundrum*, is elegantly captured by Claude Shannon's twin pillars: *confusion* and *diffusion*. Confusion aims to obscure any predictable relationship between the secret key and the ciphertext, ensuring that even small key changes produce drastic, unpredictable alterations in the output. Diffusion, conversely, seeks to dissipate the statistical structure of the plaintext across the entire ciphertext block; flipping a single plaintext bit should ideally alter every ciphertext bit with a 50% probability, creating an avalanche effect. This is the designer's ideal. The adversary's goal, however, is precisely to undermine this ideal, to find statistical weaknesses, biases, or predictable patterns hidden within the complex transformations, patterns that leak information about the key or allow the recovery of plaintext. From the catastrophic breaks of historical ciphers like the German Enigma – where cribs and rotor turnover patterns created exploitable correlations – to the modern analysis of sophisticated algorithms, the relentless tension between the designer's intent and the cryptanalyst's ingenuity defines the field.

For decades, cryptanalysis relied heavily on intuitive methods, algebraic manipulation, and the sheer, ever-increasing power of brute-force search. This landscape was revolutionized in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the public formalization of **Differential Cryptanalysis (DC)** by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir. While whispers of related ideas existed within classified government circles (notably at IBM during the DES development in the 1970s, where concepts dubbed "T-attacks" were known and countered), it was Biham and Shamir who independently discovered, rigorously developed, and unleashed DC upon the academic cryptographic community. The core principle of DC is deceptively simple yet extraordinarily powerful: instead of analyzing single plaintexts, analyze the propagation of *differences* between pairs of plaintexts as they traverse the cipher's rounds. Specifically, by carefully selecting pairs of plaintexts with a specific difference (typically defined by the bitwise XOR operation, denoted ΔP), and observing the resulting differences in their ciphertexts (ΔC), a statistical bias can emerge. This bias reveals information about the internal workings of the cipher and, crucially, the secret key. The impact was seismic. Their successful application of DC to reduced-round versions of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), and particularly the dramatic break of the FEAL-4 cipher (requiring a mere 20 chosen plaintexts compared to the 2^64 required for brute force), irrefutably demonstrated DC as a foundational cryptanalytic technique, fundamentally altering how ciphers were designed and evaluated. It shifted cryptanalysis from an art heavily reliant on intuition to a science grounded in rigorous probability theory.

However, the true engine driving the power of Differential Cryptanalysis is **Differential Trail Composition (DTC)**. DC doesn't magically exploit any arbitrary difference; its potency hinges on identifying *high-probability paths* through the cipher's internal state. DTC is the meticulous process of constructing these paths, known as *differential characteristics*. A characteristic is a hypothesized sequence of input and output differences for each round operation (S-boxes, linear diffusion layers, key additions), chained together such that the output difference of one round becomes the input difference to the next. DTC involves searching for sequences where the probability of this chain of events occurring (under the assumption of independent round keys) is significantly higher than chance. The probability of a characteristic is primarily determined by the cipher's nonlinear components, typically Substitution boxes (S-boxes). Each S-box activated by a non-zero input difference contributes a probability less than 1 to the overall characteristic probability; the goal of DTC is to find trails that minimize the number of these "active" S-boxes and maximize the individual probabilities when they *must* be active. The feasibility of a DC attack is directly dictated by the probability of the best characteristic found through DTC – an attack requiring 2^60 chosen plaintexts might be impractical, while one requiring 2^20 might be executed on a laptop. It was DTC that revealed the surprising resilience of full 16-round DES against DC in Biham and Shamir's original work; the best 15-round characteristic they found had a probability of only 2^{-47}, making a full attack vastly more complex than brute force – a testament to the IBM/NSA designers' foresight, even if the reasons remained classified for years.

This article embarks on a comprehensive exploration of Differential Trail Composition, the analytical core that powers differential cryptanalysis and shapes modern symmetric cipher design. We will trace its historical genesis, from the shadowy pre-awareness within classified projects to its explosive emergence in academia. We will build the essential mathematical foundations, dissecting the anatomy of differential characteristics, the propagation through nonlinear and linear components, and the critical, often fragile, independence assumption. The core principles and evolving methodologies of DTC itself will be examined, from insightful manual composition to the revolution brought by automated mathematical modeling using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. We will move beyond simple characteristics to explore more powerful concepts like differentials, truncated differentials, and impossible differentials. The intricate interplay between DTC and core cipher components (S-boxes, linear layers, key schedules) and different cipher structures (SPN, Feistel, ARX) will be analyzed. Crucially, we will shift perspective to see how DTC is proactively wielded by designers to build provable resistance into ciphers like AES, and examine its role in advanced attacks like boomerangs and related-key differentials. Finally, we will survey its practical impact on breaking ciphers, setting standards, and securing systems, and ponder current frontiers and future directions. Our journey begins by delving into the origins of this indispensable technique, uncovering the fascinating story of how differential cryptanalysis and its essential engine, trail composition, emerged from obscurity to reshape cryptography.

## Historical Genesis: From Concept to Formalization

The surprising resilience of full DES against Differential Cryptanalysis (DC), revealed by Biham and Shamir's own analysis, wasn't merely a fortunate accident. It was, as the cryptographic world would soon learn with a mixture of awe and retrospective clarity, the result of deliberate countermeasures developed in near-total secrecy years before DC's public debut. This revelation underscores the fascinating, often clandestine, pre-history of differential ideas, a history where the concept of tracing difference propagation – the essence of Differential Trail Composition (DTC) – flickered into existence long before its formal naming.

**2.1 Pre-Shadows: Early Glimmers of Differential Ideas**

While Biham and Shamir are rightly credited with the independent discovery and rigorous formalization of DC, the fundamental intuition – that specific input differences could lead to exploitable output biases through a multi-round cipher – existed in the shadows much earlier. The most striking instance occurred during the mid-1970s development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) at IBM. Under intense scrutiny and collaboration with the National Security Agency (NSA), the team led by Walter Tuchman, Carl Meyer, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant Tuckerman grappled with the security of their proposed cipher, Lucifer. Decades later, particularly after Biham and Shamir's work surfaced, Don Coppersmith would confirm that the team had developed and utilized a technique they called the "T-attack" or "Tickle attack". This technique explicitly involved analyzing how differences propagated through the cipher's rounds, focusing on the behavior of the S-boxes. Crucially, they recognized that certain S-box input differences led to specific, predictable output differences with non-uniform probabilities. To counter this threat, the team meticulously designed the DES S-boxes according to unpublished criteria, deliberately ensuring that no single input difference could produce a zero output difference (preventing simple trails) and minimizing the maximum differential probability (MDP) across all possible input/output difference pairs for each S-box. This design choice, shrouded in classification, directly targeted the probabilistic foundation upon which DC and DTC would later rest. Furthermore, in the academic sphere just as Biham and Shamir were preparing their seminal papers, Sean Murphy at Royal Holloway, University of London, was independently exploring the differential properties of S-boxes, publishing theoretical work in 1990 that laid bare the mathematical underpinnings of difference propagation through nonlinear components – a critical building block for formalizing trail composition. This era was characterized by a profound culture of secrecy; the NSA possessed deep knowledge of differential techniques, classifying such research and preventing its dissemination, while IBM's DES team was bound by non-disclosure agreements, leaving the broader cryptographic community largely unaware of these powerful cryptanalytic concepts.

**2.2 The Biham and Shamir Breakthrough**

Against this backdrop of isolated insights and enforced silence, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir embarked on their independent investigation into block cipher security in the late 1980s. Working without knowledge of the classified IBM/NSA work, they systematically developed the theory and practice of Differential Cryptanalysis from first principles. Their breakthrough lay not only in recognizing the power of analyzing plaintext pairs but in rigorously formalizing the entire process: defining the XOR difference metric, quantifying the probability of difference propagation through individual cipher components (especially S-boxes via Difference Distribution Tables - DDTs), and crucially, developing the methodology for *chaining* these single-round propagations into multi-round *characteristics*. Their work provided the first comprehensive framework for understanding how differences evolve through a cipher's internal state. The landmark came with their 1990 CRYPTO presentation and subsequent 1991 Journal of Cryptology paper, "Differential Cryptanalysis of DES-like Cryptosystems". Here, they unveiled the power of DC by applying it to DES variants. Their most famous result was breaking FEAL-4, a proposed fast cipher, requiring only 5-20 carefully chosen plaintext pairs – a stark contrast to brute-force's 2^64 effort. Against full 16-round DES, they found the best 15-round characteristic had a probability of approximately 2^{-55.1} (later refined), implying an attack complexity vastly exceeding brute force (2^56), thus demonstrating DES's relative strength against their new technique. This publication was a bombshell, providing not just attacks but a complete, publicly accessible methodology that instantly became a mandatory benchmark for cipher security.

**2.3 The Role of Trail Composition in Early Attacks**

Although the term "Differential Trail Composition" wasn't explicitly coined in their earliest works, the *process* was undeniably the engine driving Biham and Shamir's success. Finding the FEAL-4 break and the DES 15-round characteristic involved the painstaking, manual work of DTC. They had to:
1.  **Identify Promising Starting Points:** Analyze S-box DDTs to find high-probability differentials (e.g., an input difference causing a specific output difference with probability 1/2 or 1/4).
2.  **Chain Rounds Manually:** Determine how the output difference from one set of S-boxes, after passing through the linear diffusion layer (permutation in DES-like ciphers), would affect the input to the S-boxes in the next round. This required deep understanding of how the linear layer distributed bits.
3.  **Minimize Active S-boxes:** The core goal was to find a sequence of differences (a characteristic) that minimized the number of rounds with active S-boxes and maximized the probability when activation was unavoidable. For FEAL-4, they exploited weaknesses in its linear transformations (F-functions) to create characteristics where differences canceled out in intermediate rounds, keeping the overall probability high. This manual search was laborious and relied heavily on cryptanalytic intuition and insight into the specific cipher structure. The combinatorial explosion for larger ciphers or more rounds was immediately apparent. Early tools were primitive, often involving custom programs to check specific hypothesized paths rather than exhaustive search. Applying their methods beyond DES and FEAL, they successfully analyzed other ciphers like Lucifer variants, demonstrating the generality of their DC approach, which inherently relied on the manual composition of differential trails.

**2.4 The DES Revelation and its Aftermath**

The cryptographic community was stunned not only by the power of DC but also by the revelation, gradually confirmed by IBM and the gradual declassification of Coppersmith's 1994 CRYPTO paper ("The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Its Strength Against Attacks"), that the DES designers had anticipated and countered precisely this class of attack nearly two decades prior. The secret S-box design criteria, developed to thwart "T-attacks," were directly responsible for DES's resilience. The S-boxes were engineered to have excellent diffusion properties and, critically, a very low maximum differential probability, ensuring that any characteristic traversing multiple rounds would inevitably activate numerous S-boxes, driving the overall probability down to cryptographically negligible levels. This revelation had profound consequences. First, it validated Differential Cryptanalysis as a fundamental and potent attack vector – if the mighty NSA had feared it enough to design against it, its power was undeniable. Second, it triggered a seismic shift in cipher design philosophy. Security could no longer rest on obscurity or ad hoc principles. The DES experience demonstrated that

## Foundational Concepts: Differences, Probabilities, and Propagation

The revelation of DES's intentional resistance, achieved through S-boxes meticulously crafted to disrupt differential propagation, underscored a crucial truth: understanding the mechanics of difference evolution is fundamental to both breaking and building secure ciphers. This brings us to the essential mathematical bedrock upon which Differential Cryptanalysis (DC) and its engine, Differential Trail Composition (DTC), firmly rest. To comprehend how differences traverse a cipher's intricate structure, we must establish precise definitions and grasp the distinct roles played by each cryptographic component in shaping the path and probability of a differential trail.

**3.1 Defining the Differential: Input-Output XOR**

At the core of differential cryptanalysis lies the concept of the *difference* between two plaintext blocks, P and P'. While other difference operators exist (such as modular subtraction), the **bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)**, denoted by ⊕, reigns supreme as the primary metric. The difference ΔP is thus defined as ΔP = P ⊕ P'. Similarly, the ciphertext difference for the corresponding encryptions is ΔC = C ⊕ C', where C = E(K, P) and C' = E(K, P') under the same secret key K. The fundamental object of study in DC is the relationship between this input difference ΔP and the output difference ΔC, often referred to as a *differential pair* (ΔP, ΔC).

The dominance of XOR stems from its elegant algebraic properties within the binary field GF(2), where addition and subtraction are equivalent to XOR. This linearity simplifies the analysis significantly, especially concerning the cipher's linear components (like permutations and key addition). Furthermore, XOR differences propagate cleanly through these linear operations, allowing predictable transformations that form the scaffolding upon which nonlinear interactions are analyzed. Crucially, it's vital to distinguish terminology: a *difference* (ΔX) is a specific value (a bit string) representing the XOR between two states. A *differential* refers to the pair (Δ_in, Δ_out) for a specific component (like an S-box) or for the entire cipher, representing a potential input-output transition. The *differential probability* (DP) quantifies how likely that transition is to occur.

**3.2 The Heart: Nonlinear Components (S-boxes)**

If linear layers provide predictable structure, **Substitution boxes (S-boxes)** are the primary source of *confusion* and the critical nonlinear element governing the feasibility of differential attacks. An S-box is a small, fixed lookup table, typically mapping `n` input bits to `m` output bits (often n = m, e.g., 4x4, 6x4, 8x8). Its purpose is to destroy any linear relationship between input and output bits. The differential behavior of an S-box is exhaustively captured by its **Difference Distribution Table (DDT)**.

The DDT is a 2^n x 2^m matrix. Each entry DDT(Δ_in, Δ_out) records the number of input pairs (X, X' = X ⊕ Δ_in) for which the corresponding output pair satisfies S(X) ⊕ S(X') = Δ_out. The *probability* of the specific S-box differential (Δ_in → Δ_out) is then calculated as p_S = DDT(Δ_in, Δ_out) / 2^n. For example, consider a hypothetical 3x3 S-box. If DDT(Δ_in = 001, Δ_out = 110) = 4, and there are 2^3 = 8 possible inputs, then p_S(001 → 110) = 4/8 = 1/2. A perfectly linear S-box would have only a few entries with high counts (or even 2^n for specific Δ_in, Δ_out pairs), making differential attacks trivial. A cryptographically strong S-box, like those in DES designed to thwart "T-attacks," exhibits a DDT where probabilities are low and evenly distributed, minimizing the maximum differential probability (MDP). The DES S-boxes, for instance, were famously crafted so that no single-bit input difference could produce a zero output difference (which would imply a deterministic path for that bit), and their MDP was kept as low as possible (1/4 for 6-bit input DES S-boxes). An **active S-box** is defined as one where the input difference Δ_in ≠ 0. Only active S-boxes contribute probabilities p_S < 1 to the overall characteristic probability; S-boxes with Δ_in = 0 are inactive and always contribute p_S = 1, as their output difference is deterministically 0 regardless of the input value.

**3.3 Linear Layers: Diffusion Mechanisms**

While S-boxes provide local confusion, **linear layers** enforce *diffusion*, spreading the influence of each plaintext bit (and any difference) across the entire cipher state over multiple rounds. These layers consist of linear operations over GF(2), meaning they satisfy F(X ⊕ Y) = F(X) ⊕ F(Y). Common examples include:
*   **Bit Permutations:** Simply rearranging the order of bits (e.g., the permutation used in the PRESENT cipher).
*   **Linear Transformations via Matrix Multiplication:** Multiplying the state vector by a fixed binary matrix (e.g., the MixColumns operation in AES, implemented using multiplication by a fixed MDS matrix over GF(2^8)).
*   **Bit Shuffles or Expansions/Contractions:** Operations like the Feistel F-function expansion or DES expansion permutation, often combined with other linear steps.

The impact of a linear layer on a difference is deterministic and easy to compute: if the input difference to the linear layer is Δ_in, the output difference is Δ_out = L(Δ_in), where `L` represents the linear function. This deterministic propagation contrasts sharply with the probabilistic behavior of S-boxes. The power of a linear layer lies in its ability to rapidly activate multiple S-boxes in the next round. A single active bit entering a well-designed linear layer will typically be diffused, causing many bits in the output Δ_out to be non-zero. This Δ_out then becomes the input difference to the next layer of S-boxes, forcing many of them to become active in the subsequent round. The **avalanche effect** – where a small input change causes massive, seemingly random output changes – is largely achieved through repeated application of nonlinear S-boxes followed by high-diffusion linear layers. The efficiency of this diffusion is often measured by concepts like the *branch number*, which directly impacts how quickly DTC is forced to incorporate active S-boxes, lowering trail probability – a topic explored in depth later.

**3.4 Key Addition: A Linear Operation**

The final core component within a typical round is the **addition of the round key**. In virtually all modern ciphers, this is implemented using the bitwise XOR operation: the current state is combined with a subkey derived from the main secret key via a key schedule. The crucial observation for differential cryptanalysis is that key addition is a *linear* operation over GF(2). This has a profound consequence: **adding a round key (via XOR) does not alter the difference between two states.**

Mathematically, consider two state values at the same point in the cipher, S and S', with difference ΔS = S ⊕ S'. After XORing the *same* round key K to both, we get:
    (S ⊕ K

## The Anatomy of a Differential Characteristic

The deterministic nature of key addition – where XORing the same subkey leaves the difference ΔS unchanged, as (S ⊕ K) ⊕ (S' ⊕ K) = S ⊕ S' = ΔS – completes our foundational picture of differential propagation within a single round. This predictable behavior stands in stark contrast to the probabilistic dance of differences through nonlinear S-boxes and the deterministic yet diffusing influence of linear layers. It is precisely this interplay, repeated and chained over multiple rounds, that Differential Trail Composition seeks to orchestrate. To understand DTC, we must first dissect its fundamental building block: the **differential characteristic**, a hypothesized pathway detailing how a specific input difference evolves step-by-step through the cipher's internal state, culminating in an output difference.

**4.1 Defining a Single-Round Characteristic**

A single-round differential characteristic is a detailed blueprint for difference propagation within one complete round of the cipher. It specifies three core elements:
1.  **Input Difference (Δ_in):** The difference entering the round, applied to the full state before any round processing begins.
2.  **Sequence of Internal Differences:** The expected difference after each major operation *within* the round. Crucially, this includes the output difference after the S-box layer(s) (Δ_S_out) and the output difference after the linear diffusion layer (Δ_L_out). For a typical Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) round, the sequence is: Input State (Δ_in) → After S-boxes (Δ_S_out) → After Linear Layer (Δ_L_out) → After Key Addition (Δ_out). Note that Δ_out = Δ_L_out due to the linearity of key addition.
3.  **Output Difference (Δ_out):** The difference exiting the round, ready to become the input difference to the next round.

The probability of this single-round characteristic is not inherent to the input and output differences alone; it depends entirely on the specific internal path hypothesized, particularly how the difference interacts with the nonlinear S-boxes. The calculation hinges on the S-box Difference Distribution Tables (DDTs). For each S-box in the layer that receives a non-zero input difference (Δ_S_in, derived directly from Δ_in), the characteristic specifies the *expected* output difference (Δ_S_out) for that S-box. The probability of this specific input-output transition for the S-box is read directly from the DDT: p_S = DDT(Δ_S_in, Δ_S_out) / 2^n. The overall probability of the single-round characteristic is then the product of the probabilities of *all* the specified S-box differentials occurring simultaneously: `p_round = Π (p_S for all S-boxes affected)`. This product relies on the assumption that the S-boxes operate independently concerning difference propagation, which is generally reasonable as they process distinct input bits.

**Example:** Consider the first DES S-box (S1). Suppose a characteristic specifies that input difference Δ_in_S1 = 001011 (binary) leads to output difference Δ_out_S1 = 0010. Consulting the DES S1 DDT, we find that DDT(001011, 0010) = 14. Since DES S-boxes have 6-bit inputs, there are 2^6 = 64 possible inputs. Therefore, p_S = 14/64 ≈ 0.21875. If this was the *only* active S-box in the round (all others having Δ_in = 0, hence p_S = 1), the single-round characteristic probability would be approximately 0.21875. If another S-box was active with a specified differential having p_S = 8/64 = 0.125, the overall `p_round` would be (14/64) * (8/64) = 112 / 4096 ≈ 0.0273.

**4.2 Active S-boxes: The Cost Drivers**

The concept of **active S-boxes** is paramount in differential cryptanalysis and central to the efficiency of DTC. An S-box is considered active within a specific round characteristic if its input difference (Δ_S_in) is non-zero. This definition underscores a critical point: activity is defined relative to the *difference* entering the S-box, not the specific data values. The significance of active S-boxes lies in their direct impact on the characteristic's probability:

*   **Inactive S-boxes (Δ_in = 0):** An S-box receiving a zero input difference will always produce a zero output difference, regardless of the actual input value or the secret key. This deterministic behavior contributes a probability of 1.0 (certainty) to the round characteristic.
*   **Active S-boxes (Δ_in ≠ 0):** An S-box receiving a non-zero input difference will produce a *specific* output difference (as dictated by the characteristic) only with a probability p_S ≤ Maximum Differential Probability (MDP) < 1.0. This probability p_S, derived from the DDT, is always less than or equal to 1.0 and is frequently significantly less than 1.0 for well-designed S-boxes.

Consequently, the overall probability of a single-round characteristic `p_round` is calculated *only* over the active S-boxes: `p_round = Π (p_S for all active S-boxes)`. Inactive S-boxes, contributing 1.0, do not affect the product. Therefore, **minimizing the number of active S-boxes per round, and maximizing the individual p_S probabilities for those that must be active, is the primary objective of Differential Trail Composition.** A characteristic traversing many rounds, each containing several active S-boxes with moderate or low p_S values, will rapidly accumulate a vanishingly small total probability, rendering a DC attack based on it impractical. Biham and Shamir's analysis of full DES revealed that its S-box design, minimizing MDP and forcing a high minimum number of active S-boxes over 16 rounds, was the bulwark against their attack.

**4.3 Constructing a Multi-Round Characteristic**

Differential cryptanalysis derives its power from exploiting biases that propagate over many rounds. A single-round characteristic, while illustrative, is rarely sufficient for a meaningful attack. DTC involves chaining single-round characteristics together to form a **multi-round differential characteristic**. This chaining follows a strict rule: the output difference of round `i` (Δ_out_i) must be exactly equal to the input difference of round `i+1` (Δ_in_{i+1}). This creates a continuous hypothesized path for the difference through the entire cipher.

A full `r`-round characteristic is thus defined by the sequence of state differences at the input of each round, plus the final ciphertext difference:
(ΔP = Δ0, Δ1, Δ2, ..., Δ_{r-1}, ΔC = Δr)
Here, Δ0 is the input difference (plaintext difference ΔP), Δ1 is the input difference to round 2 (which is the output difference from round 1), Δ2 is the input to round 3, and so on, until Δr is the output difference from round r (ciphertext difference ΔC).

The **total characteristic probability (p_char)** is calculated under the assumption that the propagation in each round is independent of the others. Therefore, it is simply the

## Differential Trail Composition: Principles and Methods

The meticulous calculation of multi-round characteristic probability, \( p_{\text{char}} = \prod_{i=1}^{r} p_{\text{round}_i} \), rests upon the critical assumption of independent round transitions. While this simplification provides a practical framework, it simultaneously reveals the formidable challenge at the heart of Differential Trail Composition (DTC): navigating an exponentially exploding search space to discover the vanishingly few high-probability paths that could render a Differential Cryptanalysis (DC) attack feasible. The process of DTC is less a straightforward calculation and more an intricate treasure hunt through a labyrinth of cryptographic operations, where the prize is a trail whose probability stands defiantly above the overwhelming sea of negligible possibilities.

**5.1 The Composition Goal: Finding High-Probability Paths**

The singular objective of DTC is stark: **discover a multi-round differential characteristic \( (\Delta P = \Delta_0, \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1}, \Delta_r = \Delta C) \) with the highest possible characteristic probability \( p_{\text{char}} \).** As established, \( p_{\text{char}} \) is the product of the probabilities of the constituent single-round characteristics, primarily driven by the product of probabilities from the active S-boxes encountered along the path. Maximizing \( p_{\text{char}} \) therefore demands minimizing both the *number* of active S-boxes and the *magnitude of the penalty* (i.e., maximizing \( p_S \)) for each unavoidable active S-box. This objective, however, collides headlong with the **combinatorial explosion** inherent in the search.

Consider a cipher with 8 parallel 4-bit S-boxes per round. For a single round, the number of possible input difference patterns is \( 2^{32} - 1 \) (all non-zero differences for the 32-bit state entering the S-box layer). For each active S-box, the number of possible output differences given a specific input difference is determined by its DDT – easily 4-16 plausible outputs per input difference for a well-designed S-box. Chaining these choices over just 4 rounds involves navigating a search space with trillions of potential paths. For modern ciphers like AES (128-bit state) over 10 rounds, the search space size dwarfs the number of atoms in the observable universe. This sheer scale necessitates intelligent strategies beyond brute force:

*   **Pruning Low-Probability Paths Early:** Abandoning paths where the accumulated probability \( p_{\text{acc}} \) (the product of probabilities up to the current round) drops below a dynamically adjusted threshold. If \( p_{\text{acc}} \) becomes smaller than the current best known \( p_{\text{char}} \) for the full cipher, further exploration is futile.
*   **Exploiting Cipher Structure:** Leveraging the inherent properties of the cipher’s design to guide the search. For example:
    *   In Feistel ciphers like DES, differences introduced in one branch interact with the F-function to affect the other branch in the next round, allowing "bending" of trails across branches. Biham and Shamir masterfully exploited this asymmetry in their DES analysis.
    *   In SPN ciphers like AES, the wide-trail strategy using high-branch-number linear layers (like MixColumns) intentionally forces differences to spread rapidly, activating many S-boxes. Trail composition must work *with* or *around* this diffusion avalanche.
    *   Iterative characteristics, where a short sequence of differences repeats over multiple rounds, can sometimes be found and concatenated, simplifying the search for longer trails.

The efficiency of DTC hinges entirely on the cryptanalyst's ability to navigate this vastness, prioritizing promising avenues and ruthlessly discarding dead ends.

**5.2 Manual Composition: Insight and Intuition**

In the pioneering days of DC, spearheaded by Biham and Shamir, trail composition was an intensely manual art, demanding deep cryptanalytic intuition and intimate familiarity with the target cipher’s components. This process resembled solving a complex, probabilistic puzzle:

1.  **Identify High-Probability S-box Differentials:** The foundation was meticulously examining the DDTs of each S-box. Cryptanalysts sought differentials \( (\Delta_{in} \rightarrow \Delta_{out}) \) with the highest possible probabilities (e.g., 1/2, 1/4). These became the building blocks.
2.  **Leverage Linear Layer Properties:** Understanding how the linear diffusion layer (permutation, matrix multiplication) transformed differences was crucial. The goal was to find input differences Δ_in that, after the linear layer L, produced an output difference L(Δ_in) that aligned favorably with the input requirements of the S-boxes in the next round. Ideally, this meant minimizing the number of active S-boxes forced in the next round or ensuring that any forced active S-boxes could be satisfied by high-probability differentials identified in step 1.
3.  **Exploit Cancellation and Neutrality:** A powerful technique involved arranging differences so that they canceled out in intermediate rounds. If the output difference from one set of S-boxes, after diffusion, created an input difference for the next S-box layer that could be "neutralized" (resulting in Δ_in = 0 for some S-boxes), those S-boxes became inactive, boosting the overall probability. The FEAL-4 attack is a canonical example. Its relatively weak linear transformations within the F-function allowed Biham and Shamir to construct a characteristic where differences introduced in the first round were carefully crafted to cancel out differences entering the third round, resulting in only two rounds with active S-boxes and a high overall probability of 1/16.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Manual composition was rarely linear. Cryptanalysts would hypothesize a path for several rounds, calculate its probability, and often discover a bottleneck – a round where the required S-box differentials had very low probabilities or forced an explosion of active S-boxes later. This necessitated backtracking, tweaking differences in earlier rounds to avoid the bottleneck, and testing the new path. This iterative cycle of hypothesis, calculation, and refinement required immense patience and insight.

The success of manual DTC against FEAL-4 and reduced-round DES stands as a testament to the brilliance of these early practitioners. However, its limitations were glaringly evident against complex ciphers or full round counts, where the combinatorial complexity overwhelmed human analysis. The hunt for more systematic, automatable methods began.

**5.3 Algorithmic Search: Exhaustive and Heuristic**

To overcome the limitations of manual composition, cryptanalysts developed algorithmic approaches to explore the differential trail space. These methods varied in sophistication and scalability:

*   **Exhaustive Search:** The simplest, yet only feasible for extremely small ciphers (e.g., toy 16-bit

## Mathematical Modeling: MILP and SAT Solvers in DTC

The combinatorial explosion inherent in Differential Trail Composition (DTC), coupled with the intricate diffusion patterns and complex S-box logic of modern ciphers like AES, SKINNY, and GIFT, rendered the manual and early algorithmic methods explored in Section 5 increasingly inadequate. While insightful cryptanalysts like Biham and Shamir could manually trace promising paths through the labyrinthine structures of DES and FEAL, the sheer scale and sophistication of contemporary designs demanded a paradigm shift. The quest for high-probability trails became a mathematical optimization problem of staggering complexity, requiring tools capable of systematically navigating vast search spaces while rigorously adhering to the constraints imposed by the cipher's components. This necessity sparked a revolution in DTC, driven by the powerful computational engines of **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** and **Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)** solvers, transforming differential cryptanalysis from an art guided by intuition into a science grounded in automated reasoning.

**6.1 The Need for Automation in Complex Ciphers**

The limitations of previous methods became starkly apparent with ciphers designed explicitly to thwart differential attacks using principles like the wide-trail strategy. Consider AES: its 128-bit state, 8-bit S-boxes, and the MixColumns linear diffusion layer (an MDS matrix ensuring optimal branch number) create a structure where differences propagate rapidly and activate numerous S-boxes. Manually tracking potential paths over 10 rounds, respecting the intricate interplay between SubBytes and MixColumns, was practically impossible. Exhaustive search was utterly infeasible due to the state size. Even heuristic searches like branch-and-bound struggled with the complex constraints, particularly the need to accurately model the propagation rules dictated by the S-box Difference Distribution Tables (DDTs) and the linear algebra governing MixColumns and ShiftRows. Furthermore, lightweight ciphers like PRESENT or GIFT, while operating on smaller states (64 bits), often employ carefully crafted permutations and S-boxes designed to maximize the minimum number of active S-boxes over multiple rounds – precisely the property DTC seeks to minimize. Finding the *best* trail, crucial for determining the actual security margin, required a method that could efficiently encode the cipher's entire differential behavior and leverage sophisticated algorithms to find the optimal solution within this constrained space. This pressing need propelled the adoption of formal mathematical modeling techniques.

**6.2 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for DTC**

The breakthrough in automating and optimizing DTC came with the application of **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**. Pioneered in this context around 2011 by researchers like Nicky Mouha and colleagues, MILP provided a powerful framework to model the differential propagation constraints of a cipher as a system of linear equations and inequalities involving both continuous and integer variables, with a linear objective function to minimize or maximize. The core genius lies in translating the logical and probabilistic rules of difference propagation into linear algebra:

*   **Variables:**
    *   *Binary Activity Variables:* For each S-box position in each round, a binary variable `a_r,s` is defined (1 if the S-box is active in round `r`, position `s`; 0 otherwise). These directly link to the objective function.
    *   *Difference Variables:* For each bit (or byte/word) of the state at the input and output of each operation (S-box layer, linear layer) in each round, integer variables represent the difference value (Δ) at that point. These are often modeled as byte-level or word-level differences to reduce complexity, though bit-level modeling is possible.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   *S-box Propagation:* The relationship between the input difference (`Δ_in`) and output difference (`Δ_out`) of an S-box, governed by its DDT, is modeled. Crucially, the DDT entry `DDT(Δ_in, Δ_out)` must be non-zero for the transition to be possible. MILP models encode this by generating linear inequalities that exclude impossible transitions. For example, if a 4-bit S-box input difference `Δ_in = 5` can only produce output differences `{2, 7, 8, 13}`, constraints are added ensuring that if `a_r,s = 1` (meaning `Δ_in != 0`), then `Δ_out` must be one of these values. The probability `p_S` is often ignored for finding the minimal *number* of active S-boxes, which is the primary objective for bounding security.
    *   *Linear Layer Propagation:* Linear operations (permutations, matrix multiplications like MixColumns) are inherently linear over GF(2). Therefore, the output difference is a deterministic linear function of the input difference: `Δ_out = L * Δ_in`. This translates directly into a system of linear equations within the MILP model. For example, the effect of the AES MixColumns matrix on a column difference is precisely defined by four linear equations over GF(2^8).
    *   *Activity Linking:* Constraints link the activity variables `a_r,s` to the difference variables. Typically, `a_r,s = 1` if and only if `Δ_in_r,s != 0` for that S-box. This is enforced using auxiliary variables and constraints based on the values of the difference bits/bytes.
    *   *Chaining Differences:* The output state difference of one operation must equal the input state difference of the next operation in the round, and the output difference of round `r` must equal the input difference of round `r+1`.
*   **Objective Function:** The most common objective in DTC MILP models is to **minimize the total number of active S-boxes** over the specified number of rounds. This is expressed as the sum of all binary activity variables: `Minimize: Σ a_r,s` for all rounds `r` and S-box positions `s`. Under the independence assumption, minimizing the number of active S-boxes is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the characteristic probability (since `p_char <= (MDP)^{#active_sboxes}`).

An MILP solver (like Gurobi, CPLEX, or SCIP) takes this model – the variables, constraints, and objective – and searches for an assignment of values that satisfies all constraints while minimizing the objective function. The solution found provides the sequence of differences (the characteristic) achieving the minimal number of active S-boxes for that number of rounds. This capability revolutionized cipher design and analysis. For instance, MILP models were instrumental in formally proving the lower bounds on active S-boxes for AES (e.g., at least 25 active S-boxes in any 4-round characteristic) and for modern lightweight ciphers like SKINNY and GIFT, providing concrete security guarantees against standard DC.

**6.3 Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and SMT Approaches**

While MILP excels at optimizing the number of active S-boxes, modeling the intricate logical conditions of S-box differentials, especially for larger S-boxes (like the 8-bit AES S-box), can lead to a large number of complex linear constraints. **Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)** solvers offered a complementary, sometimes more flexible, approach. Instead of linear inequalities over integers, SAT models represent the problem purely in terms of Boolean logic.

*   **SAT Modeling:** The differential propagation is encoded as a giant logical formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Variables are Boolean (True/False), representing propositions like "bit `i` of the state before round `r` has difference

## Beyond Simple Characteristics: Differentials and Truncated Paths

The revolution brought by MILP and SAT/SMT solvers in automating the search for high-probability differential characteristics marked a quantum leap in Differential Trail Composition (DTC). These powerful tools efficiently navigate the combinatorial labyrinth of a cipher's internal state, pinpointing paths that minimize active S-boxes – the primary drivers of probability decay. However, this very efficiency illuminated a fundamental limitation inherent to the characteristic model itself. While indispensable for understanding propagation mechanics and establishing security bounds, focusing solely on a single, specific sequence of internal differences often paints an incomplete, sometimes misleading, picture of a cipher's true vulnerability to Differential Cryptanalysis (DC). The quest for cryptanalytic efficiency demanded expanding the conceptual framework of DTC beyond the confines of the simple characteristic.

**7.1 The Limitation of Characteristics: Missing Probability**

A differential characteristic \( (\Delta P = \Delta_0, \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1}, \Delta_r = \Delta C) \) represents one hypothesized pathway for the difference to propagate from input to output. Its probability \( p_{\text{char}} \) is calculated under the critical assumptions of independent round transitions and the *specific* sequence of intermediate differences \( \Delta_1, \Delta_2, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1} \). Herein lies the core limitation: **a DC attack exploiting the input-output pair \( (\Delta P, \Delta C) \) succeeds if *any* valid path connecting them exists, not just the single path specified by a particular characteristic.**

In reality, for a given input difference \( \Delta P \) and output difference \( \Delta C \), there are often *multiple* distinct sequences of intermediate differences (multiple characteristics) that could connect them. Each of these alternative paths has its own probability \( p_{\text{char}}^{(i)} \). A real-world DC attack collects pairs \( (P, P \oplus \Delta P) \) and counts how often \( C \oplus C' = \Delta C \) occurs. This observed frequency approximates the probability that *some* valid path from \( \Delta P \) to \( \Delta C \) was traversed, considering *all* possible internal difference sequences that achieve this end. Consequently, the actual effectiveness of an attack is governed not by the probability of the best single characteristic, but by the sum of the probabilities of *all* characteristics that share the same starting and ending differences, \( \Delta P \) and \( \Delta C \). This aggregate probability, known as the **differential probability (DP)**, is almost invariably larger than the probability of the best individual characteristic. Ignoring these contributing paths means the simple characteristic model inherently *underestimates* the true threat posed by a differential attack. This phenomenon was starkly evident in early DC applications; attacks frequently succeeded with significantly fewer plaintext pairs than predicted by the best known characteristic, precisely because multiple paths were contributing to the observed bias. The DES 3-round attack serves as a classic anecdote: Biham and Shamir initially found a characteristic with probability \( \frac{1}{16} \), yet the actual attack worked with a probability close to \( \frac{1}{8} \), revealing the significant contribution of other, perhaps slightly lower probability, paths converging on the same \( (\Delta P, \Delta C) \).

**7.2 Differential Probability vs. Characteristic Probability**

Formally, the **differential probability (DP)** for input difference \( \Delta P \) and output difference \( \Delta C \) over `r` rounds is defined as:
\[ \text{DP}(\Delta P, \Delta C) = \Pr[ E(K, P \oplus \Delta P) \oplus E(K, P) = \Delta C ] \]
where the probability is taken over all plaintexts `P` and all keys `K` (assuming uniform distribution). Crucially, this probability can be expressed as the sum:
\[ \text{DP}(\Delta P, \Delta C) = \sum_{\substack{\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1} \\ \text{paths connecting } \Delta P \text{ to } \Delta C}} \Pr[ (\Delta_0 = \Delta P, \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1}, \Delta_r = \Delta C) ] \]
Each term in this sum is the probability of a specific characteristic \( (\Delta P, \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_{r-1}, \Delta C) \). Therefore, the fundamental relationship is:
\[ \text{DP}(\Delta P, \Delta C) \geq \max_{\text{characteristics}} p_{\text{char}} \]
and often \( \text{DP} \gg p_{\text{char}} \) for the best known characteristic. This inequality highlights why differentials \( (\Delta P, \Delta C) \) are ultimately the cryptanalyst's true target; they capture the cumulative leakage regardless of the internal path. However, accurately calculating or even tightly bounding the true DP is notoriously difficult. While summing probabilities over all possible characteristics is theoretically sound, enumerating *all* valid characteristics for a modern cipher is computationally infeasible. Furthermore, the independence assumption underlying each characteristic's probability calculation may not hold perfectly in practice, potentially inflating or deflating the sum. Estimating DP often relies on finding the best characteristic (giving a lower bound for the attack complexity) and hoping it dominates, or using techniques like the *Walsh transform* to approximate the probability. This inherent challenge – bridging the gap between characteristic probability and true differential probability – remains a significant frontier in differential cryptanalysis. The design of AES, for example, focuses on minimizing the maximum DP for any differential over 4 rounds (exploiting its wide-trail strategy), acknowledging that security depends on bounding the aggregate probability, not just the probability of single paths.

**7.3 Truncated Differentials: Capturing Partial Information**

Faced with the combinatorial complexity of tracking full differences and the challenge of low-probability full differentials, cryptanalysts developed a powerful generalization: **truncated differentials**. Instead of specifying the exact difference value for every bit of the internal state, a truncated differential focuses only on whether specific *subsets* of bits (e.g., bytes, words) are active (non-zero) or inactive (zero). Essentially, it tracks difference patterns at a coarser granularity. A truncated differential characteristic specifies the activity pattern (active/non-active) for predefined segments of the state at the input and output of each round.

The power of truncated differentials stems from several key advantages:
1.  **Aggregation:** A single truncated characteristic actually represents a large cluster of specific full characteristics. An "active byte" means the difference in that byte is non-zero, but it doesn't specify the exact value. This aggregation inherently combines the probabilities of all specific characteristics conforming to the same activity pattern.
2.  **Higher Probability:** By ignoring the exact difference values within active segments, truncated differentials often exhibit significantly higher probabilities than any specific full characteristic tracing the same broad path. Paths that would be distinct (and individually low probability) in the full difference model collapse into a single high-probability truncated path.
3.  **Handling Complex Diffusion:** In ciphers with strong linear diffusion layers (like MixColumns in AES), the exact difference values propagate in complex, often hard-to-track ways. Truncated differentials, focusing only on

## Interaction with Cipher Components: S-Boxes and Linear Layers

The revelation that truncated differentials could capture the aggregate probability of entire clusters of full characteristics by focusing on activity patterns underscored a fundamental truth in Differential Trail Composition (DTC): the specific mathematical properties of a cipher's core components dictate not only the feasibility of finding high-probability paths but also the very nature of those paths. While Section 7 expanded the conceptual toolkit beyond single, rigid trails, the effectiveness of any DTC method—whether targeting full characteristics, differentials, or truncated paths—remains deeply intertwined with the design choices embodied in the Substitution boxes (S-boxes), linear diffusion layers, key schedules, and the overarching cipher structure. Understanding this intricate interplay is paramount for both the cryptanalyst seeking exploitable trails and the designer striving to thwart them.

**8.1 S-Box Design Criteria and DTC Impact**

The S-box stands as the primary nonlinear element, and its differential properties, encapsulated in the Difference Distribution Table (DDT), directly govern the probabilistic cost incurred each time it activates within a differential trail. Consequently, S-box design criteria are heavily influenced by DTC considerations, with the **Maximum Differential Probability (MDP)** being the single most critical metric. Defined as the highest probability across all non-zero input differences and all possible output differences in the DDT (MDP = max_{Δ_in ≠ 0, Δ_out} Pr[ S(X ⊕ Δ_in) ⊕ S(X) = Δ_out ]), the MDP establishes an absolute upper bound on the contribution of any single active S-box to a characteristic's probability. A low MDP is essential for cipher security. For instance, the DES S-boxes, meticulously crafted in the 1970s to counter "T-attacks," achieved an MDP of 1/4 for their 6-bit input size. In contrast, a hypothetical S-box with poor design might exhibit MDPs as high as 1/2 or even 1 (indicating deterministic propagation for some differences), rendering differential attacks trivial. Modern ciphers often strive for MDP as close to the theoretical minimum as possible; the AES S-box, operating on 8 bits, achieves an MDP of 4/256 = 2^{-5.415}, significantly strengthening its resistance per active S-box.

Beyond MDP, other DDT properties profoundly impact DTC. **Uniformity** – how evenly the non-zero entries are distributed within the DDT – influences the likelihood of finding multiple high-probability transitions for a given input difference, potentially aiding the composition of trails with specific output differences needed for subsequent rounds. Conversely, a high **number of zero entries (impossible differentials)** within the DDT restricts the possible output differences, potentially hindering trail propagation or forcing cryptanalysts down less probable paths. Designers face inherent trade-offs: achieving exceptionally low MDP and ideal DDT uniformity often requires larger S-boxes (like the 8-bit AES S-box) or complex combinatorial logic, increasing implementation cost in resource-constrained environments like lightweight cryptography. Smaller S-boxes (e.g., 4x4), favored for their hardware efficiency in ciphers like PRESENT or GIFT, inherently have higher minimum possible MDP (theoretical minimum is 2^{-2} for 4-bit bijective S-boxes). Designers must carefully optimize within this constraint, selecting S-boxes that minimize MDP while balancing uniformity and implementation footprint, directly shaping the landscape that DTC algorithms must navigate. The quest for efficient S-boxes with near-optimal differential properties remains an active area of research, driven by the constant pressure to maximize resistance per active S-box identified through DTC.

**8.2 Linear Layers: Branch Number and Diffusion**

While S-boxes inject probabilistic nonlinearity, linear diffusion layers (permutations, matrix multiplications) enforce deterministic spreading of differences, acting as the accelerator for the avalanche effect. Their design critically influences DTC by dictating *how many* S-boxes become active in subsequent rounds. The key metric quantifying this diffusion power is the **Branch Number (BN)**. For a linear transformation `L` operating on words, the branch number is defined as the minimum number of non-zero words (active bytes/nibbles) in the input *and* output of `L`, considering all non-zero inputs: BN(L) = min_{x ≠ 0} ( wt(x) + wt(L(x)) ), where `wt` denotes the Hamming weight (number of non-zero words).

A high branch number is crucial for rapid avalanche and strong differential resistance. Consider the impact: if a linear layer has a branch number `B`, then any non-zero input difference (with at least one active word) guarantees that the sum of active words in the input *and* output is at least `B`. Consequently, if the input to `L` has `a` active words, the output *must* have at least `(B - a)` active words. This property forces the activation of numerous S-boxes over consecutive rounds. **Maximum Distance Separable (MDS)** matrices achieve the theoretical maximum branch number possible for a given size: for an operation on `n` words, an MDS matrix has BN = n+1. The AES MixColumns operation, multiplying each 4-byte column state by a fixed MDS matrix over GF(2^8), exemplifies this, achieving BN=5. This means a single active byte entering MixColumns forces four active bytes at its output, which then become inputs to four separate S-boxes in the next round. DTC for AES-like ciphers must constantly contend with this rapid diffusion; trails inevitably accumulate active S-boxes quickly, driving probabilities down exponentially. In contrast, a simple bit permutation layer, like the one used in PRESENT (64-bit state), has a lower branch number (BN=3 for its typical nibble-based view). While still providing diffusion, it allows for more "localized" trails with potentially fewer active S-boxes per round compared to an MDS-based design, a factor DTC tools like MILP readily exploit to find bounds. The design choice between high-cost/high-diffusion MDS matrices and lower-cost/adequate-diffusion alternatives like carefully chosen permutations or near-MDS matrices is a central tension, especially in lightweight cryptography, directly shaping the minimum number of active S-boxes provable via DTC and thus the cipher's differential security margin.

**8.3 The Role of Key Schedules**

While the data path's differential propagation is central to DTC, the **key schedule**—the algorithm generating round keys from the master key—introduces another dimension of complexity, particularly concerning related-key attacks. In standard single-key DTC, the primary role of key addition is acknowledged as linear: it masks the internal state but does not alter the difference itself (Δ(S ⊕ K) = ΔS). However, the key schedule becomes critical when considering two scenarios:

1.  **Related-Key Differentials:** This powerful attack model assumes the adversary can request encryptions under multiple related keys (e.g., K and K' = K ⊕ ΔK). The differential now encompasses differences in both plaintext *and* key: (ΔP, ΔK) → (ΔC). DTC must then model the propagation

## DTC in Cipher Design: Building Resistance

The intricate interplay between key schedules and differential propagation underscores a pivotal reality: Differential Trail Composition (DTC) is not solely the cryptanalyst's scalpel, but equally the designer's shield. Having dissected how ciphers *can* be broken, we now shift perspective to how modern ciphers are meticulously *built* to resist differential cryptanalysis from inception, with DTC serving as the foundational design compass. This proactive application transforms DTC from an attack methodology into an indispensable engineering tool for achieving **provable security margins**.

**9.1 Security Margins and Provable Bounds**

The primary objective in designing a differential-resistant cipher is to ensure that any feasible differential characteristic over the full number of rounds has a probability so vanishingly small that mounting an actual attack requires computational resources far exceeding practical limits, ideally exceeding the cipher's key space size (e.g., requiring more than 2^k operations for a k-bit key). This defines the **security margin** – the number of rounds beyond which the best differential attack becomes computationally infeasible. DTC, particularly through automated tools like MILP and SAT solvers, provides the rigorous mathematical framework to establish **provable lower bounds** on the minimum number of active S-boxes over any characteristic spanning `r` rounds. Since the maximum characteristic probability `p_char` is bounded by `(MDP)^{min_active_sboxes}`, where MDP is the maximum differential probability of the S-box, proving a minimum number of active S-boxes directly translates to an upper bound on `p_char` and thus a lower bound on the attack complexity.

Consider the AES (Rijndael) as the quintessential example. Its designers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, employed the **wide trail strategy** explicitly guided by DTC principles. Utilizing the properties of the MDS MixColumns matrix (branch number 5) and the carefully chosen 8-bit S-box (MDP = 4/256 ≈ 2^{-5.415}), they could mathematically prove bounds on active S-boxes. Crucially, MILP modeling later confirmed and formalized these bounds: over any 4 consecutive rounds of AES-128, there are at least 25 active S-boxes. Given the S-box MDP, this implies `p_char <= (4/256)^25 ≈ 2^{-150}`, vastly lower than the brute-force complexity of 2^128. This bound, derived directly through DTC automation, underpins confidence in AES's differential resistance over its 10/12/14 rounds (depending on key size). Similarly, modern lightweight ciphers like SKINNY or GIFT rely heavily on MILP-generated proofs of minimum active S-box counts over various round spans to justify their security claims against DC, even when operating on smaller (e.g., 64-bit) states.

**9.2 Design Strategies Guided by DTC**

The quest for provable bounds drives specific, concrete design choices, all optimized using DTC tools:

1.  **S-box Selection for Low MDP and Good DDT:** The cornerstone is selecting S-boxes with the lowest possible Maximum Differential Probability. Designers explore vast spaces of potential S-boxes (especially for smaller sizes like 4-bit or 6-bit), evaluating candidates primarily based on their DDT. Ciphers like ANU (an Australian lightweight cipher) or the GIFT S-box were chosen specifically for their exceptionally low MDP (e.g., 2^{-2} for 4-bit S-boxes, the theoretical minimum for bijective functions) and uniform DDT distributions to minimize potential high-probability paths. Trade-offs between MDP, implementation cost (gate count in hardware), and resistance to other attacks (like linear cryptanalysis) are constantly evaluated using DTC simulations.
2.  **Linear Layers with High Branch Number:** Maximizing diffusion is critical. Designers employ linear transformations that maximize the branch number, forcing differences to spread rapidly and activate multiple S-boxes quickly. MDS matrices (like AES MixColumns) offer optimal branch number but can be expensive in hardware due to their complexity over large fields. Lightweight ciphers often opt for efficient permutations or near-MDS matrices achieving high (though not optimal) branch numbers. PRESENT uses a carefully designed bit permutation that, while not achieving MDS levels, ensures good diffusion with minimal hardware cost, a choice validated by DTC analysis showing a minimum of 10 active S-boxes over 5 rounds. The design of the linear layer is often iteratively refined using MILP to ensure it efficiently translates single active S-boxes into multiple activations in the next round.
3.  **Round Constants to Break Symmetry:** Simple iterative structures or symmetric key schedules can lead to **symmetric differential trails** or enable devastating **slide attacks**, where the trail simply repeats every round. To break this symmetry and prevent long, iterative low-probability characteristics, designers incorporate **round constants** (fixed, distinct values XORed into the state or key schedule in each round). These constants ensure that even if the linear and nonlinear transformations are identical each round, the actual inputs to the S-boxes differ, disrupting symmetric trail propagation. The SHA-3 winner Keccak (used in ciphers like Ketje and Keyak) employs intricate round constants specifically designed to disrupt symmetry and invalidate potential iterative differential paths.
4.  **Key Schedule Nonlinearity and Diffusion:** A weak key schedule can become the Achilles' heel. Designers ensure the key schedule itself incorporates nonlinear operations and sufficient diffusion to prevent predictable relationships between round keys. This complexity makes related-key differential attacks vastly harder to find and complicates DTC modeling. The AES key schedule, while criticized for some properties, uses S-boxes and a complex structure to introduce nonlinearity. Ciphers like SPECK (though later criticized for other reasons) employed a key schedule designed to be lightweight yet complex enough to hinder simple related-key differentials. DTC tools are increasingly being adapted to model key schedule interactions, allowing designers to evaluate resistance against related-key attacks during development.

**9.3 The Iterative Design-Analysis Cycle**

Modern cipher design is rarely a linear process; it is an intense **iterative cycle** powered by DTC tools. A designer proposes an initial structure (e.g., SPN, Feistel, ARX), selects components (S-box candidates, linear transformations), and specifies a tentative round count and key schedule. Automated DTC tools (primarily MILP models) are then immediately deployed:
1.  **Model Generation:** A formal MILP (or SAT) model encoding the differential propagation rules of the proposed cipher is created.
2.  **Bound Calculation:** The solver searches for the characteristic minimizing the number of active S-boxes over the proposed full number of rounds and critical subsets of rounds.
3.  **Analysis & Tweaking:** If the minimum active S-box count is too low, leading to a theoretical attack complexity below the desired security level (e.g., below 2^128), the design is *tweaked*. This could involve:
    *   Modifying the linear layer for better diffusion (higher branch number).
    *   Replacing the S-box with one offering a lower MDP.
    *   Adjusting the key schedule to introduce more diffusion or nonlinearity between rounds.
    *   Adding rounds to increase the minimum active S-box count.
4.  **Re-run and Validate:** The updated cipher is re-modeled, and the process repeats until the provable bound meets the security target.

This cycle was vividly demonstrated during the AES competition. Finalists like Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish underwent intense public scrutiny, with cryptanal

## Advanced Topics: Boomerangs, Keys, and Extensions

The relentless refinement of cipher design, driven by the iterative application of MILP and SAT solvers to bound the minimum number of active S-boxes and maximize resistance to standard differential cryptanalysis (DC), created a formidable barrier for attackers. Ciphers like AES, with its provable 25 active S-boxes over 4 rounds, or modern lightweight designs like SKINNY and GIFT, boasting similarly strong bounds derived from automated Differential Trail Composition (DTC), seemed to push the limits of practical DC attacks. Yet, the ingenuity of cryptanalysts refused to be contained. Faced with these mathematically fortified structures, they developed sophisticated techniques that leveraged DTC in novel ways, bending the rules of difference propagation and exploiting new attack vectors. This pursuit of cryptanalytic advantage, even against ciphers designed with DTC resistance in mind, propelled the evolution of advanced methods built upon the fundamental engine of trail composition.

**10.1 The Boomerang and Rectangle Attacks**

Emerging in 1999 from the insights of David Wagner, the **boomerang attack** represented a paradigm shift in exploiting differential properties. Its core brilliance lay in a form of cryptanalytic jujitsu: rather than searching for a single, impractically low-probability differential characteristic spanning the entire cipher, it combined two shorter, high-probability characteristics covering complementary parts of the encryption process. Imagine splitting the cipher `E` into two sub-ciphers: `E = E1 ∘ E0`, where `E0` covers the first few rounds and `E1` the remaining rounds. The attacker finds two differentials:
1.  A differential `α → β` for `E0` with high probability `p`.
2.  A differential `γ → δ` for `E1` with high probability `q`.

The boomerang attack exploits the probability that these differentials can be chained in a specific quartet structure. The attacker starts with a plaintext pair `(P, P')` such that `P' = P ⊕ α`. After encryption through `E0`, they yield intermediate states `(C, C')` satisfying `C' = C ⊕ β` with probability `p`. Now comes the twist: the attacker *decrypts* these intermediate states one round back under `E1` (or its inverse) using two different, but related, keys or states, creating new *ciphertext* pairs `(X, Y)` and `(X', Y')`. Crucially, the differences `γ` and `δ` are applied during this decryption phase. If the differentials align correctly, the resulting plaintext quartet `(P, Q, P', Q')` will exhibit a specific difference relationship with probability `p²q²`. This allows key recovery or distinguishing attacks often requiring significantly fewer texts than a full differential attack based on a characteristic covering `E`.

The **rectangle attack** (a chosen-plaintext variant of the boomerang) further refined this concept, eliminating the need for adaptive chosen ciphertexts. It amplifies the success probability by considering many possible intermediate differences `β'` and `γ'` that satisfy the required relationships (`β'` related to `β`, `γ'` related to `γ`), effectively aggregating probability over clusters of differentials. The role of DTC here is paramount: **finding the high-probability component trails `(α → β)` for `E0` and `(γ → δ)` for `E1` is absolutely dependent on effective trail composition techniques.** The attack's viability hinges entirely on the existence of such high-probability short trails. For instance, a seminal application targeted AES-192 and AES-256. While full differential characteristics for AES were prohibitively unlikely, researchers like Alex Biryukov found relatively high-probability differentials covering 3 or 4 rounds. Composing these into boomerang or rectangle distinguishers covering 6-7 rounds provided the best known attacks against these key lengths for several years, demonstrating the power of splitting the cipher and leveraging DTC on manageable segments. A critical caveat is the **independence assumption**: the boomerang/rectangle attack requires that the two differentials operate independently, meaning the transition through the middle (`β` to `γ`) occurs randomly. If the cipher's structure creates dependencies between `E0` and `E1`, the probability `p²q²` can overestimate the true advantage, sometimes dramatically.

**10.2 Related-Key Differential Cryptanalysis (RKDC)**

Standard differential cryptanalysis assumes the adversary only queries a single secret key. **Related-Key Differential Cryptanalysis (RKDC)** shatters this constraint, assuming a much stronger adversary capable of obtaining encryptions under multiple, cryptographically related keys (e.g., `K`, `K' = K ⊕ ΔK`, `K'' = K + c`, etc.). This expanded model allows the definition of **related-key differentials**: `(ΔP, ΔK) → ΔC`, specifying differences in both the plaintext *and* the key, which propagate to a ciphertext difference with some probability. RKDC can be devastating, as it exploits weaknesses not only in the data path but also in the key schedule's resistance to difference propagation.

The implications for DTC are profound and challenging:
1.  **Dual Propagation Modeling:** DTC must now track the propagation of differences not only through the data processing rounds but simultaneously through the key schedule algorithm. The state space explodes, as differences exist in both the data *and* the key register(s).
2.  **Interaction Points:** Wherever a round key (derived from the differing master keys) is injected into the data path via XOR or addition, the difference in the round key (`ΔK_i`) interacts with the current data difference (`ΔS_i`). While key addition itself is linear (so `Δ(S_i ⊕ K_i) = ΔS_i ⊕ ΔK_i`), the *resulting* combined difference `ΔS_i ⊕ ΔK_i` becomes the input difference to the next operation (e.g., S-boxes). This interaction can create complex, sometimes beneficial (for the attacker), sometimes destructive, interference patterns. Finding paths where these interactions lead to high-probability transitions becomes the core DTC challenge.
3.  **Increased Complexity:** Modeling related-key trails with MILP or SAT solvers requires variables and constraints for *both* the data path *and* the key schedule path, along with constraints modeling their interactions at each key addition point. The model size and solving time increase substantially, often limiting the number of rounds that can be practically analyzed. Key schedules designed with simplicity for efficiency (e.g., in some lightweight ciphers) can become particularly vulnerable.

A landmark example was the RKDC attack on the SHA-1 based block cipher SHACAL-1 by Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, and Adi Shamir. By crafting a related-key differential characteristic exploiting weaknesses in both the data transformation and the key schedule derived from SHA-1's message expansion, they mounted an attack faster than brute force. Similarly, RKDC has been a significant concern in the analysis of hash functions like SHA-2 and Skein, where the compression function uses a block cipher in a Davies-Meyer mode, and controlling internal key/state differences is possible. The threat model is severe (requiring the adversary to influence key relationships), but its potential impact necessitates that modern cipher designs rigorously analyze and fortify their key schedules against related-key differentials using adapted DTC tools.

## Practical Applications and Real-World Impact

The sophisticated evolution of Differential Trail Composition (DTC), from manual tracing of characteristics to automated proofs of resistance and advanced boomerang or related-key techniques, is not merely academic. Its true significance lies in its profound, tangible impact on the security landscape – breaking vulnerable systems, shaping global standards, and validating the resilience of those we rely upon. DTC is the rigorous testing ground where theoretical cryptanalysis meets operational reality.

**11.1 Breaking Historical and Modern Ciphers**

DTC has served as the indispensable engine behind numerous landmark cryptanalytic breaks. Biham and Shamir's initial DC attacks, powered by manual trail composition, vividly demonstrated this power. The FEAL-4 cipher was shattered with just 20 chosen plaintexts, a stark contrast to the 2^64 required for brute force, by exploiting a high-probability characteristic where differences canceled in round three, minimizing active S-boxes. Their analysis of DES, while revealing its surprising 16-round resistance, successfully broke reduced-round variants (6 rounds initially, later extended) using meticulously crafted characteristics. The LOKI cipher family, designed as DES alternatives, fell to DC primarily due to weaknesses identified through trail composition, revealing characteristics with significantly higher probabilities than DES. GOST, the Soviet block cipher standard, saw its security margins eroded through DTC revealing exploitable differentials over fewer rounds than initially believed, particularly under certain key schedule assumptions. These early successes cemented DC's reputation and DTC's role as its core methodology.

The advent of automated DTC tools like MILP and SAT solvers accelerated the cryptanalysis of modern designs. Lightweight ciphers, optimized for constrained environments, became a prime target. The NSA-designed SPECK and SIMON families, while resistant to many attacks initially, saw their security margins scrutinized. Automated DTC quickly identified differential characteristics for reduced-round versions far exceeding the designers' initial estimates, revealing that security margins needed adjustment. For instance, early analyses found practical distinguishing attacks on SPECK 32/64 (5-6 rounds) and key recovery on reduced SIMON variants using high-probability differential trails pinpointed by MILP models. Similarly, the Keccak permutation (underpinning SHA-3) underwent intense differential analysis during the NIST competition, with DTC revealing high-probability trails ("differential characteristics") over fewer rounds than the full 24, though not threatening the full construction. The practicality of these attacks hinges on the characteristic or differential probability derived through DTC: a trail with probability 2^{-30} implies an attack requiring roughly 2^{30} chosen plaintexts, potentially feasible; one with 2^{-80} is considered impractical against a 128-bit cipher. DTC provides the crucial probability estimate determining attack feasibility.

**11.2 Informing Cryptography Standards**

The influence of DTC extends far beyond breaking specific ciphers; it fundamentally shapes the algorithms selected to protect global digital infrastructure. Major standardization bodies, notably the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), mandate rigorous resistance to differential cryptanalysis, proven through DTC methods, as a non-negotiable requirement. This was vividly demonstrated during the AES competition (1997-2001). All finalists (Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, RC6, MARS) underwent intense public scrutiny, with differential cryptanalysis using both manual and emerging automated DTC techniques forming a core part of the evaluation. Rijndael's selection as AES was heavily influenced by its elegant wide-trail strategy, which enabled *provable bounds* (later formalized with MILP) on the minimum number of active S-boxes over 4 rounds (25), translating directly to an astronomically low maximum characteristic probability (2^{-150}) far below brute-force feasibility (2^{128}). The competition established that security arguments must include rigorous DTC-based analysis.

This precedent became deeply embedded in subsequent NIST initiatives. The SHA-3 competition (2007-2012) demanded candidates demonstrate resistance to differential attacks, particularly collision attacks exploiting differential paths. Keccak's eventual selection incorporated a design explicitly hardened against high-probability differential trails over its permutation rounds. Most recently, the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization project (2016-2023) made automated DTC analysis using MILP or SAT solvers a cornerstone of the evaluation criteria. Submissions *had* to include provable lower bounds on active S-boxes or similar DTC-derived metrics over the full round count. Algorithms like ASCON (the chosen AEAD/pseudo-random function standard) and SPARKLE (a finalist) showcase this, with their design iterations heavily influenced by MILP-driven optimization to maximize the proven minimum number of active S-boxes, ensuring quantifiable resistance against DC. DTC tools are no longer optional for standardization; they are the essential instruments for demonstrating baseline security.

**11.3 Impact on Security Evaluation and Certification**

Beyond influencing algorithm selection, DTC plays a critical role in the security certification of specific implementations and systems. Frameworks like the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC 15408) require vendors to provide evidence of resistance against known attack vectors, including differential cryptanalysis, for products like hardware security modules (HSMs), smart cards, and cryptographic libraries. DTC-based proofs are a primary form of this evidence. Vendors demonstrate the security of their implemented cipher by referencing the provable bounds established through MILP/SAT modeling – for instance, stating that the minimum number of active S-boxes over `r` rounds is `X`, leading to a maximum characteristic probability of `p_char <= (MDP)^X`, which necessitates an attack complexity exceeding the required security level (e.g., > 2^128 operations). This quantitative argument is far more convincing than vague claims of "strong cryptography."

Furthermore, independent security evaluations and public cryptanalysis heavily leverage DTC. Researchers continuously probe deployed ciphers, using ever-improving DTC tools to find new differential trails, even in algorithms previously thought secure. The discovery of the "Sweet32" vulnerability in 2016 highlighted this ongoing process. While not a direct break of a single cipher, it exploited the small (64-bit) block size of legacy ciphers like 3DES and Blowfish. DTC played a role in understanding how differential properties could interact with the small block size in certain modes of operation to make collision-based attacks feasible over large amounts of data. This finding directly impacted industry best practices, accelerating the deprecation of 64-bit block ciphers in favor of AES (128-bit block). Continuous DTC-driven scrutiny is vital for maintaining trust in cryptographic primitives long after their initial standardization.

**11.4 Beyond Block Ciphers: Stream Ciphers and Hash Functions**

While block ciphers are the most natural domain for DTC, its principles powerfully extend to other cryptographic primitives. Stream ciphers, generating a keystream from a key and nonce, often employ nonlinear filters or combiners. DTC techniques can analyze the differential properties of these components. For example, the Salsa20 and ChaCha family of stream ciphers, based on ARX operations (Addition, Rotation, XOR), have been analyzed using differential techniques adapted to handle the nonlinearity of modular addition. While the structure differs, the core idea of tracing difference propagation through the state update function to find biases or distinguishers remains applicable. Finding high-probability differentials in the initialization function or the keystream generation can lead to attacks distinguishing the keystream from random or recovering internal state.

DTC finds perhaps its most dramatic impact outside block ciphers in the cryptanalysis of **hash functions**, particularly for collision attacks. A collision occurs when two distinct messages `M` and `M'` produce the same hash value `H

## Current Frontiers, Debates, and Future Directions

The relentless march of Differential Trail Composition (DTC), from its clandestine origins within IBM and the NSA to its current status as the automated, mathematically rigorous backbone of both cryptanalysis and cipher design, has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of symmetric cryptography. Its journey, chronicled in previous sections, reveals a powerful dialectic: each new cipher designed with DTC-driven proofs of resistance inevitably sparks innovations in trail-finding techniques, which in turn force the next generation of designs to evolve. Yet, even as DTC matures into an indispensable engineering discipline, its frontiers continue to expand, propelled by evolving cryptographic needs, persistent theoretical challenges, and the relentless ingenuity of researchers. This final section explores the vibrant debates, open problems, and promising trajectories defining the current and future era of differential cryptanalysis and its essential engine.

**12.1 The Limits of Automation and Independence**

Despite the revolutionary success of MILP, SAT, and SMT solvers in automating the search for differential characteristics and proving bounds, significant limitations persist. The most profound challenge remains the **gap between characteristic probability (p_char) and true differential probability (DP)**. As established in Section 7, DP(ΔP, ΔC) is the sum of probabilities of *all* characteristics sharing the same input and output differences. While finding the best characteristic provides a crucial lower bound on attack complexity (based on p_char), accurately estimating or calculating the *actual* DP remains notoriously difficult for modern ciphers. Enumerating all contributing characteristics is computationally intractable, and the core **independence assumption** underlying the calculation of each p_char frequently falters. Dependencies arise from several sources:
*   **Key Schedule Interactions:** Real-world key schedules rarely produce perfectly independent round keys. Correlations between subkey differences can create statistical dependencies in the differential propagation across rounds, violating the Markov cipher assumption essential for simply multiplying p_round values. The DES key schedule, though designed decades ago, exhibits such dependencies that subtly influence differential probabilities. Modern designs strive for more nonlinear and diffusive schedules, but proving independence remains elusive.
*   **Long-Range Dependencies via State:** Complex diffusion patterns, particularly in ciphers with high branch number linear layers or intricate Feistel structures, can create situations where the propagation in later rounds depends non-trivially on the specific values or difference paths taken much earlier in the cipher, beyond the immediate previous round difference.
*   **Algorithmic Bottlenecks:** While solvers excel at finding minimum active S-box counts or specific low-probability paths, they struggle to efficiently *aggregate* probabilities over the vast number of paths contributing to a DP. Techniques exist for small ciphers or truncated differentials, but robust, scalable methods for accurate DP calculation in large, complex ciphers are a major open research problem. Recent work explores SAT-based methods to count the *number* of valid characteristics for a differential (ΔP, ΔC), which, combined with average p_S estimates, offers a better DP approximation, but computational limits remain severe.

This gap creates an ongoing debate: are provable bounds on minimum active S-boxes, while essential, sufficient to guarantee security? Or do we need deeper analysis of DP and dependency effects, particularly for ciphers operating near the security threshold? The cryptanalysis of the Simon lightweight block cipher family highlighted this concern; initial DTC bounds based on active S-boxes seemed strong, but later analyses exploiting dependencies and clustering effects found more potent attacks than predicted by the best single characteristic. Bridging this gap – developing efficient methods to bound or estimate true DP – is arguably the most critical frontier in DTC theory.

**12.2 The Post-Quantum Context**

The advent of quantum computing has ignited a global effort to standardize **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**, primarily focused on replacing vulnerable public-key algorithms like RSA and ECC with lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, or multivariate schemes. A common, sometimes misunderstood, question arises: what is the relevance of DTC and differential cryptanalysis in a post-quantum world? The answer is twofold: significant, but nuanced.

*   **Symmetric Algorithms Remain Quantum-Resistant (Mostly):** Grover's quantum search algorithm offers a quadratic speedup for exhaustive key search. For a symmetric cipher with a k-bit key, the best quantum attack reduces the effective security level to k/2 bits. Consequently, AES-128 is deemed to offer 64-bit quantum security, prompting recommendations to use AES-192 or AES-256 for long-term quantum resistance. Crucially, **Grover's attack is generic and does not leverage the internal structure of the cipher.** Differential cryptanalysis, including advanced variants like boomerangs, relies on exploiting specific structural weaknesses. There is no known quantum algorithm that provides a similar quadratic or better speedup *for structural attacks like DC*. Therefore, the security of symmetric primitives like AES, SHA-3, or ChaCha20 against differential attacks, proven via DTC, remains largely intact against quantum adversaries. DTC remains essential for designing and validating these quantum-resistant symmetric workhorses.
*   **Analyzing PQ Symmetric Primitives:** Many PQC schemes incorporate symmetric components within their constructions. Hash-based signatures (e.g., SPHINCS+) rely on the collision resistance of hash functions like SHAKE (SHA-3) or Haraka. Several Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) use symmetric ciphers for key derivation or rejection sampling. DTC is directly applicable to analyzing the differential properties of these embedded symmetric primitives. For instance, ensuring that the Keccak permutation within SHA-3 remains resistant to differential distinguishers over its full rounds is vital for the security of SPHINCS+. Similarly, the integrity of modes like AES-GCM-SIV, crucial for securing quantum key exchange, depends on the differential resistance of AES itself. Furthermore, some PQC proposals leverage novel symmetric-like structures (e.g., based on lattice operations) for authentication or encryption. Analyzing their resistance to differential attacks, adapting DTC concepts to these new algebraic settings, represents an emerging research direction, though its practical significance compared to algebraic attacks is still being explored. The resource constraints inherent in many PQC algorithms also amplify the relevance of lightweight DTC techniques for embedded symmetric components.

In essence, while quantum computing reshuffles the security hierarchy for key sizes, it reinforces rather than diminishes the importance of DTC for ensuring the structural soundness of the symmetric algorithms that will underpin both classical and quantum-resistant cryptography.

**12.3 Lightweight Cryptography Challenges**

The proliferation of resource-constrained devices (IoT sensors, RFID tags, embedded controllers) has fueled the rise of **lightweight cryptography**. Designing ciphers and hash functions that offer robust security with minimal gate count, power consumption, and latency presents unique challenges for DTC, often forcing difficult trade-offs that spark intense debate.

*   **The Efficiency-Security Tightrope:** Lightweight designs aggressively optimize every component. This often means using smaller S-boxes (4-bit instead of 8-bit) with inherently higher minimum possible MDP (2^{-2} vs 2^{-6} or lower), employing simpler linear layers (bit permutations instead of MDS matrices) with lower branch numbers, and utilizing extremely streamlined key schedules. While DTC tools like MILP are vital for finding the best possible bounds under these constraints, the fundamental tension is unavoidable: aggressive optimization for size
