                1: Conceptual Foundations of ZK-EVMs</h2>
                <p>The relentless march of blockchain technology,
                spearheaded by Ethereum’s vision of a global,
                decentralized computer, has consistently grappled with a
                fundamental constraint: scalability. As adoption surged,
                the dream of frictionless, low-cost computation for
                billions ran headlong into the harsh realities of
                decentralized consensus. Congested networks, exorbitant
                transaction fees, and environmental concerns threatened
                to stifle innovation just as its potential became
                undeniable. Enter Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual
                Machines (ZK-EVMs), a technological confluence promising
                to shatter these barriers while preserving Ethereum’s
                core security and composability. At the heart of this
                revolution lies a specific design philosophy:
                <strong>Type-2 ZK-EVM</strong>. This section lays the
                essential groundwork, dissecting the Ethereum Virtual
                Machine’s mechanics, unraveling the cryptographic magic
                of zero-knowledge proofs, and illuminating the
                formidable challenge – and profound vision – of
                synthesizing them into a seamless scaling solution.
                Understanding this foundation is paramount to
                appreciating the nuanced elegance and pivotal role of
                the Type-2 paradigm.</p>

                The Ethereum Virtual Machine: Architecture &amp;
                Limitations</h3>
                <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the
                deterministic, sandboxed runtime environment that
                executes smart contract code across the entire Ethereum
                network. It is the beating heart of Ethereum’s state
                transition function, the mechanism by which the
                blockchain progresses from one state (a snapshot of all
                accounts, balances, and contract storage) to the next
                upon processing a block of transactions. Its design
                embodies both ingenious simplicity and inherent
                constraints.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Stack-Based Architecture &amp; Opcode
                Execution:</strong> Unlike conventional processors using
                registers, the EVM employs a <em>stack-based</em>
                architecture. Imagine a physical stack of plates:
                operations primarily manipulate data by pushing values
                onto the top of the stack or popping them off. Smart
                contract code, compiled down to EVM bytecode, consists
                of a sequence of predefined operations called
                <em>opcodes</em>. Each opcode represents a fundamental
                instruction, such as <code>ADD</code> (pop two values,
                add them, push result), <code>MSTORE</code> (store a
                value in memory), <code>SLOAD</code> (load from
                storage), or <code>JUMP</code> (change program counter).
                Execution proceeds sequentially through the bytecode,
                updating the stack, a volatile <em>memory</em> space
                (cheap but erased between transactions), and persistent
                <em>storage</em> (expensive, tied to the contract). This
                deterministic execution ensures that given the same
                starting state and transaction input, every honest
                Ethereum node will compute the identical ending
                state.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State Transition Function:</strong> The
                EVM is the engine driving Ethereum’s state transition
                function: <code>S_new = F(S_old, T)</code>. Here,
                <code>S_old</code> is the global state before processing
                a new block, <code>T</code> represents the set of
                transactions within that block, <code>F</code> is the
                function computed by the EVM executing those
                transactions, and <code>S_new</code> is the resulting
                new global state. This function includes complex
                operations like contract creation, message calls between
                contracts, and managing the account trie (a Merkle
                Patricia Trie structure securing account data). The
                integrity of this state transition is the bedrock of
                Ethereum’s security – all nodes must agree on
                <code>S_new</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Scalability Trilemma:</strong> Coined
                by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the Scalability
                Trilemma posits that a blockchain inherently struggles
                to simultaneously achieve all three desirable properties
                at scale:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> A system
                requiring minimal trust in a small number of powerful
                entities (e.g., few validators, expensive
                hardware).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Resilience against
                attacks (e.g., 51% attacks, double-spends) proportional
                to the value secured.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scalability (Throughput):</strong>
                Ability to process a high number of transactions per
                second (TPS).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Traditional blockchains like Ethereum L1 prioritize
                decentralization and security. Every full node must
                re-execute every transaction (<code>F(S_old, T)</code>)
                and store the entire state to independently verify the
                new block. This creates a hard ceiling on throughput –
                limited by the processing power and storage of the
                <em>average</em> node operator to maintain
                decentralization. Increasing block size or frequency
                might boost TPS but forces node requirements higher,
                centralizing the network around entities that can afford
                powerful hardware, compromising decentralization and,
                ultimately, security (as fewer validators control the
                chain). The infamous <strong>CryptoKitties congestion
                event of December 2017</strong>, where a single popular
                dApp overwhelmed the network, causing transaction fees
                to spike and delays to stretch for hours, became a
                stark, early demonstration of this trilemma in
                action.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Gas Economics &amp; Computational
                Constraints:</strong> Ethereum introduces “gas” as a
                unit measuring the computational effort required for
                operations. Each opcode has a fixed gas cost
                (<code>ADD</code> is cheap, <code>SSTORE</code> is
                expensive). Users specify a gas limit and gas price when
                sending transactions. The fee paid is
                <code>gas_used * gas_price</code>. Gas serves critical
                functions:</li>

                or severely limited in functionality on L1. Developers
                must constantly optimize gas usage, often sacrificing

                Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Cryptographic Bedrock</h3>
                <p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent a profound
                cryptographic breakthrough, enabling one party (the
                <em>prover</em>) to convince another party (the
                <em>verifier</em>) that a specific statement is true
                <em>without revealing any information beyond the truth
                of the statement itself</em>. This seemingly paradoxical
                concept, first rigorously formalized in the 1980s by
                Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff,
                has evolved from theoretical curiosity to the
                cornerstone of modern blockchain scaling and
                privacy.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Core Properties:</strong> For a ZKP to be
                practically useful in blockchain contexts, it must
                satisfy three key properties:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Completeness:</strong> If the statement
                is true, an honest prover can convince an honest
                verifier.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Soundness:</strong> If the statement is
                false, no dishonest prover can convince an honest
                verifier (except with negligible probability).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> The verifier
                learns <em>nothing</em> about the witness (the private
                inputs that make the statement true) beyond the validity
                of the statement. The proof could be simulated without
                access to the witness.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of
                Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs):</strong> ZK-SNARKs brought ZKPs
                into practical realms. They are:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Succinct:</strong> The proof size is
                small (often just a few hundred bytes) and verification
                time is extremely fast (milliseconds), regardless of the
                complexity of the underlying computation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Non-Interactive:</strong> After an
                initial setup phase, the prover generates a single proof
                message that the verifier can check independently,
                without further back-and-forth communication.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Arguments of Knowledge:</strong> The
                prover demonstrates knowledge of a witness satisfying
                the statement.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>ZK-SNARKs rely heavily on <strong>elliptic curve
                cryptography</strong> (ECC), particularly pairings on
                curves like BN254 or BLS12-381. The security stems from
                the computational infeasibility of solving the Elliptic
                Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). The magic lies
                in encoding the computation (the statement to be proven)
                into a system of polynomial equations. The prover,
                knowing a solution (the witness), constructs a proof
                that these equations are satisfied. The verifier checks
                a single pairing equation derived from the proof and
                public inputs. However, ZK-SNARKs require a
                <strong>trusted setup ceremony</strong> for each
                specific computation circuit. This one-time ritual
                generates public parameters (a Common Reference String -
                CRS) but crucially requires the destruction of “toxic
                waste” (secret randomness used). If any participant
                retains this waste, they could forge fake proofs.
                Projects like Zcash pioneered large-scale multi-party
                computations (MPCs) for these ceremonies, involving
                thousands of participants to maximize trust
                minimization.</p>

                <li><p><strong>Scalable Transparent Arguments of
                Knowledge (ZK-STARKs):</strong> Developed by Eli
                Ben-Sasson and team at StarkWare, ZK-STARKs emerged
                partly in response to SNARK limitations:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transparent:</strong> Requires <em>no
                trusted setup</em>. Security relies solely on
                cryptographic hashes (like SHA-2 or SHA-3) and
                information-theoretic proofs, making them post-quantum
                resistant.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scalable:</strong> Proving time scales
                quasi-linearly with computation size, and verification
                remains logarithmic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Post-Quantum Security:</strong> Based on
                hash collisions, not ECDLP, making them resistant to
                attacks from future quantum computers.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>STARKs encode computations using polynomial
                constraints and leverage <strong>hash functions</strong>
                to build Merkle trees proving the consistency of
                low-degree polynomials. While proofs are larger than
                SNARKs (tens of kilobytes) and verification can be
                slightly more computationally intensive (though still
                fast), the elimination of trusted setup and quantum
                resistance are major advantages. The <strong>FRI
                protocol (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of
                Proximity)</strong> is a core component enabling
                efficient low-degree testing.</p>

                <li><strong>From Specific to General: The Evolution of
                ZKPs:</strong> Early ZKP applications focused on niche
                privacy. <strong>Zcash (launched 2016)</strong>, using
                SNARKs (originally based on the Pinocchio protocol,
                later upgraded), allowed shielded transactions proving
                assets were spent correctly without revealing sender,
                receiver, or amount. However, these proofs were for
                fixed, relatively simple computations (verifying digital
                signatures and balance commitments). The breakthrough
                towards <strong>general-purpose ZKPs</strong> came with
                the development of frameworks allowing developers to
                express arbitrary computations in high-level languages
                and compile them down to the arithmetic circuits
                required by SNARKs (e.g., libsnark, bellman, Circom) or
                the algebraic execution traces for STARKs (Cairo). This
                paved the way for proving the correct execution of
                complex programs, including, critically, the entire EVM
                execution trace. The concept of a
                “<strong>ZKVM</strong>” (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine)
                emerged – a VM whose execution could be proven
                succinctly and verified cheaply.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>ZKPs provide the mathematical machinery to prove that
                a computation was performed correctly <em>without</em>
                re-executing it and <em>without</em> revealing
                potentially sensitive inputs. This offers a tantalizing
                solution to blockchain scaling: move computation
                off-chain, generate a ZK proof of its correctness, and
                only post the small proof and essential state changes to
                the L1 blockchain for cheap and fast verification. The
                security of L1 guarantees the validity of the off-chain
                computation. This is the core promise of ZK-Rollups, and
                ZK-EVMs are specialized ZK-Rollups focused on executing
                Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.</p>

                The ZK-EVM Synthesis: Vision and Challenges</h3>
                <p>The vision is clear: leverage ZKPs to create a Layer
                2 (L2) scaling solution that inherits Ethereum’s
                security guarantees but operates with vastly higher
                throughput and lower fees, all while maintaining
                <em>perfect compatibility</em> with the existing
                Ethereum developer ecosystem and deployed contracts.
                This is the essence of a ZK-EVM. Specifically, a ZK-EVM
                generates a zero-knowledge proof attesting to the
                correctness of EVM state transitions executed
                off-chain.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Defining the ZK-EVM:</strong> At its core, a
                ZK-EVM is a system that:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Executes EVM-Compatible
                Transactions:</strong> Processes transactions (including
                smart contract calls) according to the EVM
                specification.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Generates a Validity Proof:</strong>
                Produces a cryptographic proof (ZK-SNARK or ZK-STARK)
                demonstrating that the execution was performed
                correctly, given the initial state and the transactions.
                This proof verifies that the new state root published to
                L1 is the correct result.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Settles on Ethereum L1:</strong> Posts
                the new state root, essential data (calldata for
                rollups, proofs for validity), and the validity proof to
                Ethereum L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Relies on L1 for Verification &amp;
                Dispute Resolution:</strong> Ethereum smart contracts
                verify the ZK proofs. Validity proofs offer
                <strong>cryptographic finality</strong> – once verified
                on L1, the state transition is irreversible. There is no
                challenge period like in Optimistic Rollups.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Formidable Technical
                Hurdles:</strong> Synthesizing the complex, often quirky
                EVM with the rigorous mathematical constraints of
                efficient ZK proof systems is extraordinarily
                challenging:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Non-Determinism:</strong> While the EVM
                itself is deterministic, real-world execution
                environments introduce variations that must be handled
                identically for proofs to be reproducible. Examples
                include precise gas metering (especially for operations
                involving memory expansion), the exact behavior of
                precompiles (see below), and handling of edge cases like
                out-of-gas errors or stack overflows. Any deviation in
                how these are handled between the prover and the EVM
                specification breaks equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Precompiles:</strong> Ethereum includes
                highly optimized, native contracts (“precompiles”) for
                computationally intensive operations like cryptographic
                primitives (<code>ecrecover</code> for ECDSA signature
                verification, <code>sha256</code>,
                <code>ripemd160</code>, <code>mod_exp</code> for modular
                exponentiation, and the complex pairings for
                <code>bn256_add</code>, <code>bn256_scalar_mul</code>,
                <code>bn256_pairing</code>). These are implemented in
                native Go/Rust/C++ on Ethereum clients, not EVM
                bytecode. Proving these within a ZK circuit is
                notoriously expensive. Strategies include:</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Direct Circuit Implementation:</em> Building
                a custom ZK circuit for the precompile. Highly accurate
                but often computationally prohibitive (e.g., proving
                <code>keccak256</code> efficiently was a major early
                hurdle).</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Emulation via EVM Bytecode:</em> Replacing
                the precompile call with equivalent EVM bytecode. This
                simplifies the prover (only needs to handle standard
                opcodes) but can be less efficient and requires careful
                equivalence testing.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Specialized Proof Systems:</em> Using a
                different, more efficient proof system specifically for
                the precompile and aggregating it with the main proof
                (e.g., using a STARK for <code>keccak</code> inside a
                SNARK-based ZK-EVM).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cost-Effective Proof Generation:</strong>
                The single biggest practical barrier. Generating ZK
                proofs for complex EVM execution traces is
                computationally intensive. Early ZK-Rollups (e.g.,
                Loopring, zkSync 1.0) avoided the EVM entirely, opting
                for custom VMs with simpler, ZK-friendly operations
                (e.g., using RedShift STARKs or SNARKs over custom
                circuits). Proving a single significant Ethereum block
                containing diverse smart contract interactions could
                take hours or days on commodity hardware, making it
                impractical. The quest became: How to make proving EVM
                execution <em>fast enough</em> and <em>cheap enough</em>
                to be viable for real-time block production? This
                demanded breakthroughs in arithmetization, constraint
                system design, lookup arguments, parallelization, and
                hardware acceleration.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Vitalik Buterin’s Typology: Charting the
                Design Space:</strong> Recognizing the spectrum of
                approaches and trade-offs emerging in the ZK-EVM
                landscape, Vitalik Buterin proposed a seminal
                <strong>classification system (Types 1 through
                4)</strong> in August 2022, refined in subsequent
                writings:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 1 (Fully
                Ethereum-Equivalent):</strong> Aims for perfect
                equivalence to Ethereum at the execution layer. No
                changes to Ethereum itself needed. Proves Ethereum
                blocks directly. Highest compatibility but currently the
                hardest to build efficiently (proof times
                slowest).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 2 (EVM-Equivalent):</strong>
                <em>This is the focus of our exploration.</em> Matches
                the EVM <em>opcode behavior and state structure</em>
                exactly. Might make minor, non-breaking changes to the
                <em>system-level</em> aspects (e.g., block structure,
                gas costs, precompile handling <em>if</em> done
                carefully to preserve bytecode-level equivalence). Goal
                is that <em>existing Ethereum contracts deploy and run
                byte-for-byte identical without modification</em>, and
                <em>all existing tooling (debuggers, indexers, block
                explorers) work seamlessly</em>. Balances high
                compatibility with significantly improved proving
                efficiency over Type 1. Examples: Scroll, Polygon zkEVM
                (targeting Type 2), Taiko.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 3 (Almost EVM-Equivalent):</strong>
                Very similar to the EVM but makes deliberate trade-offs
                for greater prover efficiency. Certain precompiles might
                be missing or modified, gas costs might differ
                noticeably, and some obscure edge-case opcode behaviors
                might not be perfectly replicated. Requires some
                contract adjustments for deployment but minimizes
                changes. Offers better performance than Type 2.
                Examples: Early Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era (though
                evolving).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 4 (High-Level Language
                Equivalent):</strong> Compiles high-level Solidity/Vyper

                Not compatible with the EVM itself. Existing EVM
                bytecode <em>cannot</em> be deployed directly. Offers
                the highest potential proving performance but sacrifices
                Ethereum compatibility most significantly. Requires
                developers to recompile and potentially adjust code.

                <p>Buterin positioned <strong>Type 2 as the “sweet
                spot”</strong> for long-term Ethereum scaling. It offers
                near-perfect compatibility, enabling the vast existing
                ecosystem of contracts, tools, and developer knowledge
                to migrate frictionlessly, while achieving proof
                generation speeds viable for production use. Type 2
                ZK-EVMs are not merely scaling tools; they are
                <strong>compatibility engines</strong>, preserving
                Ethereum’s network effects while unlocking its next
                performance tier.</p>
                <p>The conceptual stage is set. We understand the engine
                we need to prove (the EVM), the powerful cryptographic
                tool we wield (ZKPs), and the ambitious goal of merging
                them efficiently and compatibly (the ZK-EVM vision,
                crystallized in the Type-2 paradigm). The path forward,
                however, is paved with intricate technical choices and
                hard-won innovations. The next section dives deep into
                the defining characteristics, philosophical
                underpinnings, and comparative landscape of the Type-2

                2: Defining the Type-2 Paradigm</h2>
                <p>The conceptual landscape laid bare in Section 1
                revealed a stark reality: bridging the chasm between
                Ethereum’s intricate execution environment and the
                rigorous demands of efficient zero-knowledge proof
                generation was a Herculean task. Vitalik Buterin’s
                typology provided a crucial framework, not merely
                categorizing approaches but illuminating a spectrum of
                trade-offs – a spectrum where <strong>Type-2
                ZK-EVMs</strong> emerged as the pragmatic epicenter.
                Positioned as the “sweet spot,” Type-2 promised a
                delicate balancing act: preserving the sanctity of the
                Ethereum developer experience and deployed contract
                ecosystem while achieving proof generation speeds viable
                for real-world scaling. But what precisely defines this
                paradigm? How does it navigate the treacherous terrain
                between perfect fidelity and practical efficiency? This
                section dissects the DNA of Type-2 ZK-EVMs, contrasting
                its philosophy and mechanics against its siblings in the
                ZK-EVM family and scrutinizing the elusive standard of
                “EVM-equivalence.”</p>
                <h3 id="core-tenets-of-type-2-zk-evms">2.1 Core Tenets
                of Type-2 ZK-EVMs</h3>
                <p>The Type-2 ZK-EVM is not defined by a single
                technical specification, but by a <em>philosophy</em>
                centered on <strong>maximizing compatibility with
                minimal, justifiable divergence</strong>. Its core
                tenets form a triad of principles guiding its
                design:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Exact Equivalence to EVM Opcode Behavior and
                State Structure:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Bytecode is Law:</strong> The most sacred
                covenant. Existing, compiled Ethereum smart contract
                bytecode must execute <em>identically</em> on the Type-2
                ZK-EVM as it does on Ethereum L1. Every opcode –
                <code>CALL</code>, <code>SLOAD</code>,
                <code>JUMPI</code>, <code>MSTORE8</code> – must exhibit
                precisely the same input-output behavior, stack
                manipulation, memory effects, and gas consumption <em>as
                defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper and client
                implementations</em>. This includes faithfully
                replicating seemingly esoteric edge cases: the precise
                gas cost of <code>SSTORE</code> when clearing a non-zero
                slot to zero (triggering an ETH refund), the behavior of
                <code>DELEGATECALL</code> in the context of
                <code>msg.sender</code>, the handling of out-of-gas
                errors mid-execution, and the deterministic yet complex
                results of operations like <code>EXP</code> or
                <code>DIV</code> (especially division by zero, which
                must halt execution without state changes, consuming all
                gas).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State as Ethereum Knows It:</strong> The
                global state must be structured identically to
                Ethereum’s Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT). Account storage
                (a separate MPT per contract), nonces, balances, and
                contract code hashes must be stored and accessed using
                the same trie structures and hashing algorithms
                (Keccak-256). This is non-negotiable for seamless
                interoperability. A contract deployed on L1 must produce
                the same storage root hash when its state is updated on
                the Type-2 L2, and vice-versa. This ensures that proofs
                generated about L2 state transitions are verifiable
                against the same cryptographic commitments used by L1.
                Projects like <strong>Scroll</strong> invested
                significant effort in ensuring their state tree
                implementation mirrored Geth’s down to the subtlest
                details of trie node serialization and hashing.</p></li>

                Compatibility:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Developer Ecosystem
                Unchanged:</strong> The power of Ethereum lies not just
                in its virtual machine, but in the vast ecosystem of
                tools built around it. A Type-2 ZK-EVM aims to be
                invisible to this ecosystem. Developers must be able to
                use their existing workflow without
                modification:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>IDEs &amp; Frameworks:</strong> Hardhat,
                Foundry, Remix, Truffle should compile, deploy, and
                interact with contracts on the Type-2 chain identically
                to L1 or a local testnet. Foundry’s
                <code>forge test</code> should run without
                alterations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Debuggers &amp; Tracers:</strong> Tools
                like the Remix debugger, Tenderly, or specialized
                tracers must function correctly, allowing developers to
                step through opcode execution, inspect
                stack/memory/storage, and identify gas hotspots exactly
                as they would on Ethereum.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Block Explorers &amp; Indexers:</strong>
                Etherscan-like explorers (e.g., Blockscout, custom L2
                explorers) must display transactions, blocks, contract
                interactions, and internal calls correctly. Thesauri
                like Dune Analytics or Flipside must be able to parse
                and index L2 data using the same schemas and queries as
                L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Wallets &amp; RPCs:</strong> MetaMask,
                WalletConnect, and other wallets should connect via
                standard Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints
                (<code>eth_sendTransaction</code>,
                <code>eth_call</code>, <code>eth_getLogs</code>). No
                custom integrations or network-specific overrides should
                be needed for basic interaction.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “No Recompile” Promise:</strong>
                Existing contracts deployed on Ethereum L1 should be
                redeployable <em>using their existing, immutable
                bytecode</em> onto the Type-2 L2. Developers shouldn’t
                need to recompile their Solidity/Vyper code with a
                special compiler targeting a different VM. This
                preserves the integrity and audit history of deployed
                code. <strong>Scroll’s mainnet launch in October
                2023</strong> heavily emphasized this, successfully
                porting major protocols like Uniswap V3 using their
                original L1 bytecode.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Trade-off: Developer Convenience
                vs. Proof-Generation Efficiency:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Inevitable Compromise:</strong>
                Perfect equivalence comes at a cost. Proving the
                execution of complex, unoptimized EVM opcodes,
                especially those involving heavy cryptography (like
                Keccak-256 hashing within the MPT) or memory operations,
                is computationally expensive. The Type-2 philosophy
                accepts that <em>some</em> divergence is necessary to
                achieve viable performance, but strictly limits it to
                areas <em>outside</em> the core EVM execution semantics
                and state structure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Where Divergence is Permissible
                (Carefully):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>System-Level Parameters:</strong> Block
                structure (e.g., omitting fields like
                <code>difficulty</code> post-Merge), block gas limits
                (often much higher than L1), and <em>minor</em>
                adjustments to base gas costs <em>if</em> absolutely
                necessary for proving feasibility (though major
                deviations violate equivalence). Transaction formats
                might be optimized (e.g., EIP-1559 parameters).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Precompile Handling:</strong> This is
                often the primary battleground. Type-2 implementations
                may choose <em>how</em> to implement precompiles for
                efficiency, as long as the <em>observable behavior</em>
                from the perspective of the executing contract (input
                -&gt; output, gas consumed) is identical to L1. For
                example, a Type-2 might replace a native
                <code>keccak256</code> precompile call with an
                equivalent sequence of EVM opcodes internally
                <em>if</em> it can prove this sequence behaves
                identically and consumes the correct gas. Alternatively,
                it might use a highly optimized custom circuit for the
                precompile but ensure its interface (input/output/gas)
                is byte-identical. <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong>, while
                initially launched closer to Type-3, explicitly targeted
                Type-2 equivalence and focused heavily on achieving
                efficient, accurate precompile proofs (like
                <code>ecRecover</code>) through custom STARK-based
                circuits integrated within its SNARK prover.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Prover-Specific Optimizations:</strong>
                Underlying proof system choices (PLONK vs. STARK
                vs. Groth16), arithmetization techniques,
                parallelization strategies, and hardware acceleration
                (GPUs, FPGAs) are implementation details <em>as long as
                they don’t break equivalence</em>. The goal is to make
                the prover faster and cheaper without altering the
                results the developer sees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Red Line:</strong> Any divergence
                that breaks existing bytecode, alters contract state
                semantics, or renders standard tooling unusable pushes
                the implementation towards Type-3. The Type-2 mantra is:
                <em>“The EVM as the developer and contract experience
                it, must be indistinguishable from Ethereum L1.”</em>
                Efficiency gains are pursued relentlessly, but never at
                the cost of breaking this fundamental covenant.</p></li>

                reflects fundamental engineering choices with profound
                implications for security, performance, compatibility,
                and adoption. Understanding Type-2 requires situating it
                within this continuum:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Type-1 (Fully
                Ethereum-Equivalent):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Perfect, drop-in
                replacement for an Ethereum execution client. Proves
                <em>actual Ethereum blocks</em> as they are. Requires no
                changes to Ethereum consensus.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> 100% fidelity to
                Ethereum at all levels: EVM, precompiles, gas costs,
                block structure, state tree, networking stack.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ultimate security and
                compatibility. Inherits all of Ethereum’s
                decentralization assumptions directly. Ideal for
                “enshrined” ZK-rollups potentially integrated directly
                into Ethereum’s protocol in the distant future.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Extremely slow proving
                times currently. Proving the full complexity of Ethereum
                blocks, including all system-level overhead and every
                idiosyncrasy of every precompile in their native form,
                is computationally prohibitive for real-time block
                production. Requires Ethereum itself to adopt
                ZK-friendliness over time. <strong>The Ethereum
                Foundation’s Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE)
                group</strong> actively researches Type-1 as a long-term
                goal, but it remains primarily theoretical for
                production rollups today. Proof times for a full block
                can be orders of magnitude slower than Type-2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Adoption Driver:</strong> Maximum
                security for applications where the absolute highest
                level of L1 equivalence is paramount, regardless of cost
                or latency (e.g., core settlement layers, highly
                conservative DeFi protocols <em>if</em> performance
                becomes viable).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-2 (EVM-Equivalent):</strong> (As
                detailed above)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Perfect compatibility with
                existing EVM bytecode and developer tools, with minor
                system-level optimizations for proving
                efficiency.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> Bytecode execution
                and state structure are identical. Precompiles
                <em>behave</em> identically. Minor system-level
                deviations possible.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Near-perfect developer and
                contract portability. Seamless use of existing tooling.
                Strong security inheriting Ethereum’s base layer.
                Significantly better proving performance than

                <li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Proof generation is still
                computationally heavy (though improving rapidly).
                Requires careful engineering to avoid breaking
                equivalence, especially with precompiles and gas
                metering edge cases. Slightly higher complexity than
                Type-3/4.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Adoption Driver:</strong> Ecosystem
                growth and developer adoption. Ideal for general-purpose
                L2s aiming to absorb the vast majority of existing
                Ethereum dApps and developers with minimal friction.
                Projects like <strong>Scroll</strong>, <strong>Polygon
                zkEVM</strong>, and <strong>Taiko</strong> explicitly
                target this model.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-3 (Almost
                EVM-Equivalent):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> High compatibility for
                easier dApp porting, but makes deliberate sacrifices for
                significantly better prover performance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> Most common EVM
                opcodes work identically. <em>Some</em> precompiles
                might be missing, modified, or emulated with slight
                behavioral differences. Gas costs often differ
                substantially. Obscure edge-case opcode behaviors might
                not be replicated. Contract bytecode <em>might</em> need
                recompilation with a custom compiler in some
                cases.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Much faster and cheaper
                proof generation than Type-2. Easier to implement
                initially. Still allows most Solidity/Vyper code to be
                ported, often with only minor adjustments.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Breaks compatibility with
                some existing contracts, especially those relying on
                specific precompiles, precise gas consumption for
                security (e.g., gas token patterns), or obscure opcode
                semantics. Tooling might require adaptations or custom
                versions. Potential security risks if the deviations
                introduce subtle inconsistencies.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Adoption Driver:</strong>
                Performance-focused applications where absolute bytecode
                fidelity is less critical than throughput and cost. A
                stepping stone towards Type-2. <strong>zkSync Era (v2)
                initially launched as closer to Type-3</strong> (e.g.,
                differences in <code>ADDMOD</code>/<code>MULMOD</code>
                behavior, custom <code>system contracts</code> replacing
                some precompiles, different gas costs) but has
                progressively moved closer to Type-2 equivalence over
                time. <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong> also began nearer
                to Type-3 before its Type-2 pivot.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-4 (High-Level Language
                Equivalent):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximum prover performance
                by completely abstracting away the EVM. Compiles
                Solidity/Vyper directly to a custom, ZK-optimized
                bytecode or virtual machine.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> None at the EVM
                level. Source code compatibility only. Existing EVM
                bytecode <em>cannot</em> be deployed. Requires
                recompilation and often significant code
                adjustments.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fastest proof generation
                times. Potential for novel optimizations impossible
                within EVM constraints. Can offer unique features
                tailored to the ZK environment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Breaks all existing
                tooling and deployed contracts. Requires developers to
                learn new concepts, compilers, and potentially new
                languages (e.g., Cairo for StarkNet). Creates ecosystem
                fragmentation. Security audits need to consider the new
                compiler and VM.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Adoption Driver:</strong> Greenfield
                applications prioritizing ultimate scalability and cost,
                where Ethereum compatibility is a secondary concern, or
                for entirely new use cases leveraging ZK-specific
                features (e.g., StarkNet’s focus on composability and
                novel apps). <strong>zkSync 1.0 (Loopring)</strong> and
                <strong>StarkNet</strong> are prime examples. While
                zkSync Era (v2) moved towards EVM compatibility
                (Type-3), StarkNet remains firmly Type-4 with its Cairo
                VM.</p></li>

                or potentially modifying code paths touching
                precompiles. Porting to a Type-4 like StarkNet would
                require a complete rewrite in Cairo, re-auditing, and

                “EVM-Equivalent” Standard</h3>
                <p>The term “EVM-equivalent” is the cornerstone of
                Type-2, but its practical meaning requires rigorous
                definition beyond marketing slogans. It’s a standard
                forged in the crucible of real-world implementation and
                testing.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Bytecode-Level vs. Language-Level
                Compatibility:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Crucial Distinction:</strong> This is
                the defining line between Type-2/3 and Type-4.
                <strong>Bytecode-level equivalence</strong> means the
                <em>compiled artifact</em> (the sequence of EVM opcodes
                deployed on-chain) executes correctly.
                <strong>Language-level equivalence</strong> means the
                <em>source code</em> (Solidity, Vyper) can be compiled
                to run on a different VM, but the resulting bytecode is
                <em>not</em> EVM-compatible. Type-2 is fundamentally
                about bytecode-level equivalence. This ensures:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Contract Immutability:</strong> Deployed,
                audited code remains functional.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Determinism:</strong> Execution is
                guaranteed by the known EVM rules, not the nuances of a
                new compiler.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Tooling Reliance:</strong> Debuggers and
                analyzers work because they understand EVM opcodes, not
                a custom IR or VM.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Compiler’s Role:</strong> A Type-2
                ZK-EVM <em>does not require a custom compiler</em> for
                Solidity/Vyper. Developers use standard compilers
                (<code>solc</code>, <code>vyper</code>). The ZK-EVM
                executes the <em>output</em> of these compilers. In
                contrast, Type-4 systems <em>are</em> defined by their
                custom compiler (e.g., <code>starknet-compile</code> for
                Cairo, zkSync’s <code>zksolc</code>
                originally).</p></li>

                Test:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p>Precompiles represent the most significant
                technical challenge to achieving true equivalence. Their
                efficient and accurate implementation is often the
                litmus test for a Type-2 claim.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Strategies Under
                Scrutiny:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Direct Circuit Implementation (Gold
                Standard):</strong> Building a ZK circuit that precisely
                mirrors the native code of the precompile (e.g., the
                Keccak-f[1600] permutation in Rust/Go). This offers the
                highest fidelity but is computationally daunting.
                Projects like Scroll and Polygon zkEVM invest heavily in
                highly optimized custom circuits for key precompiles
                (<code>ecRecover</code>, <code>keccak256</code>, modular
                exponentiation).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>EVM Bytecode Emulation:</strong>
                Replacing the precompile call (e.g., <code>0x02</code>
                for <code>SHA256</code>) with a sequence of standard EVM
                opcodes that implement the same logic. This simplifies
                the prover (only handles basic opcodes) but
                risks:</p></li>
                <li><p>Slight behavioral differences (e.g., in error
                handling or gas consumption).</p></li>
                <li><p>Higher <em>actual</em> gas consumption within the
                L2 environment than the native precompile would use on
                L1, breaking equivalence <em>from the user’s
                perspective</em> even if the final result is
                correct.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong> Using a
                specialized proof system (like a STARK) for the
                precompile execution and embedding that proof within the
                main ZK-SNARK proof of the EVM execution trace. Polygon
                zkEVM utilizes this, leveraging STARKs for
                computationally intensive steps within its SNARK
                prover.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Keccak Conundrum:</strong> The
                <code>keccak256</code> hash function is ubiquitous in
                Ethereum (state tries, contract storage,
                <code>CREATE2</code> addresses). Its sponge construction
                is inherently sequential and relatively ZK-unfriendly.
                Efficiently proving millions of Keccak hashes per block
                was a major breakthrough. Techniques like
                <strong>Plookup</strong> and <strong>Custom
                Gates</strong> in Halo2 (used by Scroll, Taiko) or
                specialized STARKs (used by Polygon) were critical
                enablers for Type-2 performance. The <strong>“Paris
                test”</strong> – ensuring the hash of the empty string
                (<code>c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470</code>)
                is correctly computed <em>within the circuit</em> using
                the exact same padding and absorption steps as Ethereum
                – became a symbolic milestone for teams.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gas Cost Divergence: Implications for
                dApp Portability:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Ideal:</strong> Gas costs per opcode
                and for precompiles match Ethereum L1 exactly. This
                ensures contracts relying on precise gas calculations
                (e.g., for reentrancy guards, gas token mechanisms, or
                complex gas estimation logic) work identically.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Minor divergences
                often exist in Type-2 implementations, primarily due to
                the overhead of ZK proof generation itself, which isn’t
                present on L1. While the <em>opcode execution</em> gas
                might match L1, the L2 transaction fee
                includes:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>L1 Data Publishing Cost:</strong> Paying
                for calldata posted to Ethereum (if a rollup).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Verification Cost:</strong> Paying for
                the gas to verify the ZK proof contract on L1.</p></li>

                Margin.</strong></p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> While the
                <em>execution</em> gas might be equivalent, the
                <em>total fee</em> structure is inherently different.
                Furthermore, some Type-2 implementations might
                <em>slightly</em> adjust base costs for notoriously
                expensive-to-prove operations (like
                <code>KECCAK256</code> or <code>SSTORE</code>) to make
                overall fees more predictable or competitive,
                <em>if</em> they can do so without breaking core
                contract logic. This requires careful analysis.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Most dApps function
                correctly despite minor gas differences. However,
                applications with intricate gas-sensitive logic (e.g.,
                gas refund mechanisms, very precise gas estimation for
                complex multi-call transactions, or exploiting gas costs
                for economic security) need thorough testing on the
                target Type-2 chain. The Type-2 standard
                <em>strives</em> for gas cost parity at the opcode level
                but acknowledges the different underlying fee model.
                Complete transparency from L2s about their gas cost
                schedules is essential.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The “EVM-equivalent” standard, therefore, is not a
                static badge but a continuous pursuit. It demands
                rigorous testing suites, transparent documentation of
                any divergence, and unwavering commitment to the
                principle that for the developer and the deployed
                contract, the environment <em>feels</em> and
                <em>behaves</em> like Ethereum. Projects like Scroll
                pioneered extensive <strong>“zkEVM-equivalence” test
                suites</strong>, derived from Ethereum’s own execution
                client tests (Hive tests, EIP tests) and augmented with
                custom checks for ZK-specific edge cases, running
                continuously to catch regressions. It’s this relentless
                focus on fidelity, constrained only by the unavoidable
                realities of ZK proving efficiency, that defines the
                Type-2 ethos. It positions these ZK-EVMs not just as
                scaling solutions, but as seamless extensions of the
                Ethereum universe itself.</p>
                <p>The Type-2 paradigm, with its clear principles and
                defined boundaries, provides the blueprint. But
                transforming this blueprint into functioning reality
                required years of relentless innovation, theoretical
                breakthroughs, and pragmatic engineering. The journey

                its commitment to bytecode-level equivalence and
                seamless developer experience, emerged not as a sudden

                narrative.</p>

                Predecessors &amp; Pioneering Projects (2018-2021)</h3>
                <p>The genesis of ZK-EVMs lies not in direct EVM
                emulation, but in the pragmatic pursuit of scalability
                through specialized application rollups and custom
                virtual machines. These early pioneers proved the core
                concept of validity-proof-based scaling while
                inadvertently highlighting the immense challenge of
                generalizing it to Ethereum’s full complexity.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Loopring Protocol: Scaling Exchange Logic
                (Late 2019):</strong> Among the first production
                ZK-Rollups, Loopring focused on a highly specific use
                case: decentralized exchange order matching and
                settlement. By designing a <strong>custom circuit
                optimized solely for exchange operations</strong> (order
                placement, cancellation, trade settlement, merkle tree
                updates), Loopring sidestepped the EVM’s complexity
                entirely. Its ZK-SNARKs (initially Groth16, later
                upgraded) proved the validity of batches of trades
                off-chain, settling final state roots on Ethereum L1.
                While achieving impressive throughput and low fees for
                its niche, Loopring demonstrated the performance gap
                between a <strong>domain-specific circuit</strong> and
                the <strong>general-purpose computational
                behemoth</strong> of the EVM. Its success, however,
                provided crucial validation for the ZK-Rollup model’s
                security and efficiency potential, inspiring broader
                ambitions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Key Limitation:</strong> Incompatible
                with general smart contracts; developers couldn’t deploy
                arbitrary Solidity code.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>zkSync 1.0: The Custom VM Path (June 2020
                - Mainnet):</strong> Matter Labs’ zkSync 1.0 represented
                a significant leap towards generality while still
                consciously avoiding the EVM. It introduced a
                <strong>custom Zinc VM and a domain-specific language
                (Zinc)</strong>, later supporting Solidity compilation
                <em>to this custom bytecode</em>. This was a
                quintessential <strong>Type-4 approach</strong>. The
                custom VM was meticulously designed to be “ZK-friendly,”
                utilizing operations and data structures that generated
                proofs efficiently using SNARKs (initially based on
                RedShift, a transparent STARK variant). zkSync 1.0
                successfully enabled payments and simple token swaps
                with drastically lower fees than L1, proving that a more
                general ZK-Rollup was viable.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Key Limitations &amp;
                Lessons:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Tooling Fracture:</strong> Required a
                custom compiler (<code>zksolc</code>), breaking
                compatibility with standard EVM debuggers and analysis
                tools. Developers faced a new learning curve.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Limited Expressiveness:</strong> The
                custom VM couldn’t support the full range of EVM opcodes
                or complex contract interactions. Porting existing dApps
                was difficult or impossible without significant
                rewrites.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance Ceiling:</strong> While
                faster than attempting early EVM proofs, the custom
                approach still had limitations, and the fundamental
                trade-off between compatibility and efficiency was
                starkly evident. zkSync 1.0 paved the way but
                highlighted the <em>need</em> for EVM equivalence to
                unlock the broader ecosystem.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll’s Genesis: Academia Meets Ethereum
                (2021 - Research Phase):</strong> Unlike its
                predecessors focused on immediate deployment, Scroll
                emerged from deep collaboration between academic
                researchers and the Ethereum Foundation’s Privacy and
                Scaling Explorations (PSE) group. Co-founded by Ye
                Zhang, Sandy Peng, and Haichen Shen, Scroll embarked
                with an explicit, ambitious goal: <strong>building a
                bytecode-compatible ZK-EVM from first
                principles</strong>. Early efforts focused on
                foundational research:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Formalizing the EVM:</strong> Rigorously
                defining the EVM’s execution semantics in a
                mathematically provable framework.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Circuit Design Exploration:</strong>
                Investigating novel arithmetization techniques to
                represent EVM opcodes as efficient ZK constraints.
                Initial prototypes focused on proving simple contract
                executions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Open-Source Ethos:</strong> Committing
                from the outset to building transparently and
                collaboratively, laying the groundwork for community
                trust and rigorous peer review. This academic rigor
                positioned Scroll as a frontrunner in the pursuit of
                pure equivalence, albeit initially far from production
                readiness.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon Hermez: Acquisition and the
                Type-3 Starting Point (August 2021):</strong> Polygon’s
                aggressive scaling strategy led to the acquisition of
                Hermez Network (a payment-focused ZK-Rollup) for $250
                million, rebranding it as Polygon Hermez. The mandate
                shifted towards building a general-purpose
                <strong>zkEVM</strong>. Recognizing the immense
                challenge of full equivalence, the initial Polygon zkEVM
                (launched in beta in early 2023) opted for a
                <strong>Type-3 approach</strong>. Key
                characteristics:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Modified EVM:</strong> Made deliberate
                trade-offs for prover efficiency. Certain precompiles
                were missing or handled differently. Gas costs diverged
                noticeably from Ethereum L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Custom Compiler
                (<code>zkevm-compiler</code>):</strong> Required
                developers to recompile Solidity code specifically for
                the Polygon zkEVM environment, generating custom
                bytecode not directly deployable on Ethereum
                L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance Focus:</strong> Prioritized
                getting a functional, performant prover to market,
                accepting that achieving full equivalence would be an
                iterative journey. This pragmatic “launch and improve”
                strategy allowed Polygon to gather real-world data and
                developer feedback quickly.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Type-2 Pivot Announced:</strong>
                Crucially, even at launch, Polygon explicitly stated its
                roadmap target was <strong>full Type-2
                equivalence</strong>, framing the Type-3 launch as a
                necessary stepping stone. This signaled the
                industry-wide recognition that Type-2 was the ultimate
                goal for mass adoption.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This period (2018-2021) was characterized by
                proof-of-concept viability for specific applications
                (Loopring) and the emergence of general-purpose, but
                non-EVM-compatible, ZK-Rollups (zkSync 1.0). Polygon’s
                entry and Scroll’s foundational research shifted the
                focus squarely onto the EVM equivalence problem, setting
                the stage for the cryptographic breakthroughs needed to
                make Type-2 a reality.</p>

                Breakthroughs in ZK Circuit Design (2021-2023)</h3>
                <p>The transition from theoretical possibility to
                practical Type-2 implementation hinged on fundamental
                advancements in the underlying ZK proof systems and
                circuit design methodologies. This period witnessed an
                explosion of innovation, primarily focused on making the
                complex, often sequential, and stateful operations of
                the EVM efficiently provable in zero-knowledge.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Plonk &amp; Halo2: Flexible
                Arithmetization Frameworks:</strong> The shift from
                monolithic proof systems (like Groth16) to universal and
                updatable frameworks was critical.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Plonk (Proofs for Large Outer-Nonkernel
                Arguments):</strong> Pioneered by Ariel Gabizon, Zac
                Williamson, and Oana Ciobotaru from Aztec Protocol,
                Plonk introduced a <strong>universal and updatable
                trusted setup</strong>. Unlike Groth16, which required a
                circuit-specific setup, a single Plonk setup (like the
                perpetual Powers of Tau ceremony) could support
                <em>any</em> circuit below a certain size limit. This
                drastically reduced ceremony overhead and increased
                flexibility. Its use of <strong>polynomial
                commitments</strong> (initially KZG, later options like
                Bulletproofs or FRI became possible) provided the
                necessary efficiency.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Halo2: Recursion &amp; Custom Gates (2021
                - Present):</strong> Developed by the Electric Coin
                Company (creators of Zcash), Halo2 built upon Plonk’s
                foundation but introduced revolutionary capabilities
                essential for ZK-EVMs:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Recursive Proof Composition:</strong>
                Halo2 natively supports efficient <strong>verification
                of proofs within proofs</strong>. This is fundamental
                for scaling ZK-EVMs, allowing large blocks of
                transactions to be proven incrementally (e.g., per
                transaction or per opcode group) and then aggregated
                into a single succinct proof for L1 verification.
                Without recursion, proving an entire block would be
                computationally intractable.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Custom Gates &amp; Chip Design:</strong>
                Halo2 allows developers to define <strong>custom
                arithmetic gates</strong> tailored to specific expensive
                operations prevalent in the EVM. Instead of forcing
                every operation into a generic arithmetic circuit
                (highly inefficient), specialized “chips” could be
                designed. For example:</p></li>
                <li><p>A dedicated “Keccak chip” implementing the
                specific permutation rounds and bit manipulations of
                Keccak-256 far more efficiently than generic
                constraints.</p></li>
                <li><p>An “ECRECOVER chip” optimized for elliptic curve
                operations required for signature verification.</p></li>
                <li><p>A “memory access chip” handling the complexities
                of the EVM’s linear memory model. Projects like
                <strong>Scroll</strong> and <strong>Taiko</strong>
                adopted Halo2 as their core proving framework,
                leveraging these features extensively. <strong>Scroll’s
                fork, “Scroll ZK Circuit,”</strong> became a central
                repository for their battle-tested Halo2 EVM
                circuits.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lookup Arguments: Taming Non-Arithmetic
                Operations:</strong> Many critical EVM operations
                involve non-arithmetic relationships – checking if a
                value exists in a table (like valid jump destinations or
                precompiled contract addresses), verifying memory
                reads/writes against a history, or confirming the
                correctness of cryptographic hashes where inputs map to
                outputs via complex, non-polynomial functions. Proving
                these with traditional arithmetic constraints is
                prohibitively expensive. Enter <strong>lookup
                arguments</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Plookup (2020) &amp; Later Improvements
                (LogUp, cq, etc.):</strong> Introduced by Aztec
                Protocol, Plookup allowed the prover to show that a
                tuple of values <code>(a, b, c)</code> exists within a
                predefined lookup table <code>T</code>, without
                revealing the specific location. This was a
                game-changer.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Application to EVM:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory &amp; Stack Consistency:</strong>
                Instead of proving every memory write with polynomial
                constraints, a lookup argument could prove that a read
                operation correctly fetches the last value written to a
                specific address within the execution trace
                history.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Keccak-256:</strong> While custom gates
                helped, lookup arguments proved crucial for efficiently
                handling the S-box substitutions within the
                Keccak-f[1600] permutation, drastically reducing the
                constraint count per hash.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Opcodes like <code>JUMP</code>:</strong>
                Verifying that a jump destination is within the bounds
                of valid code and points to a <code>JUMPDEST</code>
                opcode could be efficiently handled via lookups into the
                contract’s bytecode table.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Precompile Input/Output:</strong>
                Checking that the inputs and outputs of a precompile
                call match the expected deterministic function could be
                modeled as a lookup. The integration of efficient lookup
                arguments, particularly within Halo2-based provers, was
                arguably <em>the</em> single most significant
                breakthrough enabling performant Type-2 ZK-EVMs. It
                turned previously infeasible operations into manageable
                ones.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Recursive Proof Systems &amp;
                Aggregation: Scaling the Prover:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Proving an entire
                block of EVM transactions, potentially involving
                thousands of complex smart contract interactions, is too
                heavy for a single proof computation. It needs to be
                broken down.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Recursive Composition:</strong> As
                mentioned with Halo2, the ability to verify proofs
                within proofs allows hierarchical aggregation. Smaller
                proofs (e.g., for individual transactions or basic
                blocks of opcodes) can be generated in parallel. These
                are then aggregated into progressively larger proofs,
                culminating in a single proof for the entire block. This
                leverages parallel processing and distributes the
                computational load.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Boojum: Powering zkSync’s Aggregation
                (2023):</strong> Matter Labs developed
                <strong>Boojum</strong>, a high-performance, open-source
                STARK-based recursive proof system designed specifically
                as a “folding verifier” for their zkSync Era ZK Stack.
                While zkSync Era started closer to Type-3, Boojum
                represented a major leap in aggregation efficiency,
                significantly reducing the computational resources
                needed to generate the final SNARK proof submitted to
                L1. Its design principles influenced broader thinking
                about efficient recursion.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parallel Witness Generation:</strong>
                Beyond proof recursion, the generation of the “witness”
                (the private inputs satisfying the circuit constraints)
                for a large EVM trace is massively parallelizable.
                Projects invested heavily in techniques to split
                execution traces across multiple CPU cores or GPUs,
                drastically reducing the time to generate the witness
                data <em>before</em> proof computation begins.
                <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong> heavily utilized GPU
                acceleration for both witness generation and STARK
                proving.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taming the Precompile Beast:</strong>
                Precompiles remained a core battleground. Strategies
                evolved:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll:</strong> Developed highly
                optimized Halo2 circuits for critical precompiles like
                <code>ECRECOVER</code> and <code>SHA256</code>,
                rigorously tested against Ethereum’s native outputs. For
                <code>KECCAK256</code>, they combined custom gates with
                lookup arguments.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM:</strong> Leveraged its
                <strong>STARK-based prover</strong> (inherited from its
                Hermez lineage) to handle computationally intensive
                precompiles like <code>KECCAK256</code> and modular
                exponentiation (<code>MODEXP</code>) within specialized,
                efficient STARK circuits. These STARK proofs were then
                wrapped within the main SNARK proof using polynomial
                commitments, creating a hybrid proof system. This
                “<strong>SNARK-wrapped STARK</strong>” approach
                exploited the strengths of each proof type.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Industry-Wide Benchmarking:</strong>
                Projects collaborated (sometimes competitively) on
                standardized benchmarks for precompile proving times and
                gas cost equivalence, pushing each other towards greater
                efficiency and accuracy. The <strong>“EVM
                Benchmarks”</strong> initiative provided shared datasets
                for comparison.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>By mid-2023, the convergence of these breakthroughs –
                flexible proving frameworks (Halo2), efficient lookups,
                scalable recursion/aggregation, and specialized
                precompile handling – transformed Type-2 ZK-EVMs from an
                ambitious research project into an impending engineering
                reality. The stage was set for the mainnet era.</p>

                Mainnet Launches &amp; Ecosystem Inflection Points (2023
                - Present)</h3>
                <p>The years of research, development, and testing
                culminated in a series of landmark mainnet deployments,
                marking the transition of Type-2 ZK-EVMs from
                theoretical constructs to live infrastructure powering
                real user transactions and dApps. These launches
                represented not just technical achievements, but pivotal
                moments shaping the Ethereum scaling ecosystem.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll: The Purist’s Type-2 Debut
                (October 17, 2023):</strong> After over two years of
                meticulous research, public testnets (Goerli, Sepolia),
                and rigorous security audits, <strong>Scroll became the
                first production Type-2 ZK-EVM to launch on Ethereum
                mainnet.</strong> This event was highly symbolic,
                validating the feasibility of the “pure” Type-2 approach
                focused on maximal compatibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Key Features &amp;
                Validation:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bytecode Equivalence:</strong> Emphasized
                deploying existing L1 contracts <em>without
                modification</em>. Early adopters like Uniswap V3
                successfully deployed using their original
                bytecode.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Open-Source Prover:</strong> Released its
                entire prover stack (including the Scroll ZK Circuit
                based on Halo2) as open-source shortly after mainnet
                launch, fostering transparency and community
                trust.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ethereum Foundation Alignment:</strong>
                Deep technical collaboration with EF PSE continued,
                contributing research back to the broader ecosystem
                (e.g., advancements in lookup arguments).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Developer Experience Focus:</strong>
                Ensured compatibility with Hardhat, Foundry, and
                MetaMask via standard RPCs. The <strong>Scroll Debug
                Toolkit</strong> began development to provide
                ZK-specific insights into proving stages.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Scroll’s launch proved
                that uncompromising EVM equivalence was achievable. It
                set a high bar for compatibility and became a reference
                implementation for the Type-2 standard. While initial
                proving times were relatively high (minutes per batch),
                it demonstrated the core functionality was viable and
                secure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM: The Strategic Type-2 Pivot
                (March 27, 2023 - Beta, Type-3; March 2024 - Type-2
                Claim):</strong> Polygon executed a deliberate roadmap,
                launching its zkEVM in beta as a Type-3 system and
                methodically working towards its Type-2 goal.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Beta Launch (Type-3):</strong>
                Focused on performance and gathering ecosystem traction.
                Offered significantly higher TPS than Scroll’s initial
                mainnet but required custom compilers and had known
                deviations in precompile behavior and gas costs. Major
                DeFi protocols like Aave deployed adapted
                versions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Type 2 Prover” Achievement (March
                2024):</strong> Polygon announced the completion of its
                <strong>“Type 2 Prover”</strong>, signifying that the
                core execution engine and proving system now met the
                bytecode-level equivalence standard for all EVM opcodes
                and precompiles. This involved:</p></li>
                <li><p>Closing known gaps in precompile fidelity (e.g.,
                precise <code>KECCAK256</code>,
                <code>ECRECOVER</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p>Achieving gas cost parity with Ethereum L1 at the
                opcode level.</p></li>
                <li><p>Transitioning to using the standard
                <code>solc</code> compiler, allowing deployment of
                vanilla L1 bytecode.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Integration with CDK &amp;
                AggLayer:</strong> Polygon positioned its Type-2 zkEVM
                as the flagship chain within its broader ecosystem
                strategy. The <strong>Polygon Chain Development Kit
                (CDK)</strong> allows other projects to launch their own
                ZK-powered L2s using Polygon’s tech stack. The
                <strong>AggLayer</strong>, launched in February 2024,
                aims to provide near-instant atomic composability and
                unified liquidity across all CDK chains <em>and</em> the
                Polygon zkEVM itself, leveraging ZK proofs for
                cross-chain state verification. This made the Type-2
                zkEVM not just a standalone chain, but the cornerstone
                of a unified ZK-powered “Value Layer.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance &amp; Hybrid Proofs:</strong>
                Polygon continued leveraging its STARK-based prover for
                heavy computation (like Keccak) within the SNARK
                wrapper, aiming for competitive proving times and
                throughput. Its established infrastructure and developer
                relationships accelerated adoption post-Type-2
                achievement.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taiko: Based Rollup &amp; Multi-Proofs
                (Mainnet Alpha - January 2024):</strong> Taiko adopted a
                distinct architectural philosophy while targeting Type-2
                equivalence, launching its “Katla” testnet in late 2022
                and mainnet alpha in early 2024.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Based Rollup” Model:</strong> Taiko
                innovated by eliminating dedicated centralized
                sequencers. Instead, it directly utilizes
                <strong>Ethereum block builders (proposers)</strong> to
                sequence Taiko blocks <em>on Ethereum L1</em>. This
                inherits Ethereum L1’s liveness and censorship
                resistance properties directly, as L1 proposers are
                economically incentivized to include Taiko blocks just
                like any other L1 transaction. It represents a unique
                approach to decentralization from day one.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-2 Equivalence:</strong> Like Scroll
                and Polygon, Taiko committed to and achieved
                bytecode-level EVM equivalence, using a modified Geth
                client and Halo2-based proving. It emphasized passing
                Ethereum’s standard execution tests.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Multi-Proof System (Guardian
                Provers):</strong> To enhance security and liveness,
                Taiko employs a <strong>multi-proof system</strong>.
                Alongside the primary ZK validity proofs generated by
                permissionless “Regular Provers,” Taiko utilizes
                “<strong>Guardian Provers</strong>”. These can
                optionally generate additional proofs using different
                technologies (initially leveraging Intel SGX secure
                enclaves, with plans for diverse methods like
                coprocessors). If the ZK prover fails or is delayed, the
                Guardian proofs provide temporary liveness guarantees
                and censorship resistance, creating a safety net during
                the bootstrapping phase. This multi-faceted approach
                aimed to mitigate risks associated with nascent ZK
                proving technology.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Contestable Rollups:</strong> Taiko
                incorporates a mechanism where nodes can contest invalid
                state transitions. While validity proofs should make
                this impossible if correct, this adds another layer of
                scrutiny and potential slashing for provers attempting
                fraud during the early stages or in case of undiscovered
                prover bugs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ecosystem Inflection: Adoption, Bridges,
                and the Future:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>dApp Migration Momentum:</strong>
                Following the mainnet launches, a wave of major
                protocols began deploying or announcing deployments on
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Uniswap V3:</strong> Deployed on Scroll
                shortly after mainnet, serving as a high-profile
                validation of bytecode equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Aave:</strong> Explored cross-chain
                governance and deployments, recognizing the security
                benefits of ZK-Rollups.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Curve Finance:</strong> Evaluated
                multiple ZK-EVMs for deploying liquidity pools,
                attracted by low fees and security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>SushiSwap, Balancer, Lens
                Protocol:</strong> Among others announcing deployments
                or active development.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bridging Infrastructure
                Maturation:</strong> Secure bridging solutions evolved
                rapidly. Native bridges provided by the rollups
                themselves (like Scroll Bridge, Polygon zkEVM Bridge)
                were augmented by robust third-party interoperability
                protocols like <strong>LayerZero, Hyperlane, and
                deBridge</strong>, facilitating seamless asset and data
                transfer between L1, Type-2 L2s, and other
                chains.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance Benchmarks (Early 2024
                Snapshot):</strong> While rapidly evolving, early
                mainnet benchmarks highlighted the progress and
                remaining challenges:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Throughput (TPS):</strong> Polygon zkEVM
                (Type-2 config) and Taiko demonstrated higher peak TPS
                (~50-100+ TPS sustained) compared to Scroll’s initial
                mainnet (~10-20 TPS), reflecting different optimization
                priorities and hybrid proof approaches. All were orders
                of magnitude above Ethereum L1 (~15 TPS).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>End-to-End Finality:</strong> Time from
                transaction submission to full L1 finality (including
                proof generation and verification) ranged from ~10-20
                minutes for Polygon zkEVM and Taiko to ~30-60+ minutes
                for early Scroll mainnet. Improvements via
                parallelization and hardware were ongoing.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proving Cost:</strong> The dominant cost
                component. Projects employed batch aggregation (bundling
                many transactions into one proof) and fee abstraction
                models to keep user fees low (cents per transaction)
                despite high underlying proving resource costs (GPU
                server time).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Competitive Landscape:</strong> The
                launches solidified a competitive “Big Three” in the
                Type-2 space (Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, Taiko), each with
                distinct architectural philosophies (purist open-source,
                ecosystem-centric CDK, based rollup/multi-proof) but
                united by the Type-2 compatibility standard. This
                competition drove rapid innovation in prover efficiency
                and developer tooling.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The mainnet launches of Scroll, Polygon zkEVM
                (achieving Type-2), and Taiko in late 2023 and early
                2024 marked the end of the beginning for Type-2 ZK-EVMs.
                They transitioned the technology from bleeding-edge
                research and promising testnets into operational
                infrastructure underpinning a growing segment of
                Ethereum’s economy. The focus shifted from “can it be
                built?” to “how can we make it faster, cheaper, and more
                decentralized?” – questions addressed by the intricate
                technical architectures explored in the next section.

                Type-2 ZK-EVMs crystallized into tangible reality
                through the audacious engineering feats of pioneering
                projects. By late 2023 and early 2024, the landscape
                shifted from promising testnets to operational mainnets,
                each embodying the Type-2 paradigm – bytecode
                equivalence, tooling compatibility – yet diverging
                significantly in architectural philosophy, proving
                strategies, and ecosystem positioning. This section
                dissects the triumvirate of leading production Type-2

                <h3 id="scroll-the-purists-approach">5.1 Scroll: The
                Purist’s Approach</h3>
                <p>Emerging from deep roots within Ethereum Foundation
                research, Scroll positioned itself as the
                standard-bearer for uncompromising Type-2 equivalence.
                Its October 2023 mainnet launch wasn’t merely a product
                release; it was a statement of principle, demonstrating
                that rigorous adherence to Ethereum’s execution
                semantics could be achieved in a production
                ZK-Rollup.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Open-Source Ethos and Ethereum Foundation
                Alignment:</strong> Scroll’s DNA is fundamentally open.
                Unlike competitors who initially launched with
                closed-source provers, <strong>Scroll open-sourced its
                entire prover stack</strong>, including the critical
                “Scroll ZK Circuit” built on Halo2, shortly after
                mainnet launch. This radical transparency served
                multiple purposes:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Community Trust &amp; Auditing:</strong>
                Allowing public scrutiny of the complex circuits mapping
                EVM opcodes to ZK constraints fostered immense trust
                within the security-conscious Ethereum community.
                Researchers and developers worldwide could verify the
                equivalence claims and contribute improvements.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Collaborative Advancement:</strong> By
                releasing foundational ZK-EVM components like its Keccak
                and ECRecover circuits under permissive licenses, Scroll
                actively contributed to the global ZK-EVM knowledge
                pool, accelerating progress for the entire ecosystem.
                This aligned perfectly with its origins in collaboration
                with the Ethereum Foundation’s PSE group.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Reference Implementation:</strong> Scroll
                consciously positioned its implementation as a
                <strong>reference Type-2 ZK-EVM</strong>. Its meticulous
                documentation of design choices and equivalence testing
                methodology became a valuable resource for other
                projects and researchers striving for bytecode-level
                fidelity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bytecode-Level Equivalence Testing
                Methodology:</strong> Scroll’s commitment to equivalence
                wasn’t aspirational; it was rigorously enforced through
                an extensive, multi-layered testing regime:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ethereum Execution Tests:</strong> Direct
                integration and continuous running of Ethereum’s own
                extensive test suites designed for its execution clients
                (Geth, Nethermind). This included the Hive test harness,
                the Ethereum State Tests, and Blockchain Tests, ensuring
                core opcode behavior, state transition rules, and edge
                cases (like out-of-gas handling, stack overflows)
                matched L1 exactly.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Forked Geth Client:</strong> Scroll’s
                node software is a <strong>fork of go-ethereum
                (Geth)</strong>, the most widely used Ethereum execution
                client. This provided a battle-tested foundation for
                transaction execution, state management (Merkle Patricia
                Trie), and JSON-RPC compatibility. Modifications were
                strictly limited to interfacing with the prover and
                handling L2-specific block parameters.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>zkEVM-Specific Test Suites:</strong>
                Beyond Ethereum’s tests, Scroll developed comprehensive
                custom tests targeting ZK-specific challenges:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Precompile Fidelity Tests:</strong>
                Thousands of vectors testing inputs and outputs for
                <code>ECRECOVER</code>, <code>SHA256</code>,
                <code>RIPEMD160</code>, <code>MODEXP</code>, and
                <code>BN256</code> operations against native Ethereum
                outputs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gas Metering Tests:</strong> Ensuring gas
                consumption per opcode and throughout complex contract
                executions precisely mirrored L1 behavior, crucial for
                contracts relying on gas-sensitive logic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Tooling Integration Tests:</strong>
                Validating seamless operation with Hardhat, Foundry,
                MetaMask, Etherscan-style explorers (Blockscout), and
                Tenderly for debugging. The <strong>Scroll Debug
                Toolkit</strong> was developed to provide ZK-specific
                insights, visualizing proof generation stages alongside
                traditional execution traces.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Real-World Bytecode Deployment:</strong>
                The ultimate test was deploying major, unmodified L1
                contracts. <strong>Uniswap V3’s deployment on Scroll
                mainnet within weeks of launch</strong> served as a
                powerful validation. The complex math of concentrated
                liquidity, fee accounting, and flash swaps executed
                flawlessly using the original, audited bytecode deployed
                on Ethereum L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Centralized Sequencer Roadmap

                speed, Scroll launched with a <strong>temporary
                centralized sequencer</strong>. This sequencer was

                <li><p><strong>Permissionless Proving:</strong> Opening
                the prover role to anyone with sufficient hardware
                (GPUs/FPGAs initially), creating a competitive market
                for proof generation. This leverages Halo2’s inherent
                support for parallel proving.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralized Sequencing:</strong>
                Implementing a permissionless sequencer network, likely
                based on Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators take
                turns proposing blocks. Mechanisms for leader election
                (e.g., VDFs) and slashing for liveness failures are
                under active research.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Governance:</strong> Transitioning
                control over protocol upgrades and parameters to a
                decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), likely
                governed by a native token (details yet to be finalized
                as of mid-2024).</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> The initial
                centralization allowed Scroll to focus resources on
                stabilizing the core proving technology and ensuring
                equivalence, accepting slower initial TPS and relying on
                trusted operators during the bootstrapping phase. The
                community largely accepted this trade-off given Scroll’s
                transparency and commitment to the decentralization
                roadmap.</li>

                compatibility and trustworthiness, proving the pure
                approach was viable, even if its initial performance

                Polygon zkEVM: Type-2 as Ecosystem Catalyst</h3>
                <p>Polygon Labs approached Type-2 not merely as a
                standalone scaling solution, but as the technological
                linchpin for a vast, interconnected ecosystem of
                ZK-powered chains. Its journey from a Type-3 beta launch
                to achieving full Type-2 equivalence in early 2024
                exemplified a strategic, performance-driven path,
                tightly integrated with Polygon’s broader “Value Layer”
                vision.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>zkEVM Type-2 vs. Type-1 Prover
                Parallelization:</strong> Polygon made a distinctive
                architectural choice: <strong>developing both a Type-2
                and a Type-1 prover in parallel</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-2 Prover (Production
                Focus):</strong> Launched in beta as Type-3 and upgraded
                to Type-2 equivalence in Q1 2024, this prover powers the
                main Polygon zkEVM chain. It prioritizes performance and
                practical viability for real-world dApps <em>today</em>,
                utilizing optimizations permissible under the Type-2
                standard (e.g., hybrid proofs). Its achievement of
                bytecode equivalence involved closing key gaps in
                precompile fidelity (especially <code>KECCAK256</code>
                and <code>ECRECOVER</code>) and aligning gas costs
                precisely with L1, enabling deployment of unmodified L1
                contracts like <strong>Aave</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-1 Prover (Research &amp;
                Future):</strong> Developed in collaboration with the
                Ethereum Foundation’s PSE group (similar to Scroll’s
                origins), this prover aims for true full Ethereum
                equivalence, capable of proving actual Ethereum L1
                blocks. This is a longer-term research project, focusing
                on the ultimate security and compatibility goal, but not
                yet suitable for production L2 throughput demands. This
                dual-track strategy allows Polygon to deliver performant
                scaling now while contributing to Ethereum’s most
                ambitious future scaling visions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Prover Tech: SNARK-wrapped
                STARKs:</strong> Polygon zkEVM’s proving system is a
                sophisticated hybrid. At its core lies a <strong>STARK
                prover</strong>, inherited from the Hermez acquisition
                and highly optimized for parallel computation
                (leveraging GPUs). This STARK prover handles the
                computationally intensive portions of the EVM execution
                trace, particularly expensive precompiles like
                <code>KECCAK256</code> and <code>MODEXP</code>. The
                resulting STARK proof is then wrapped within a
                <strong>SNARK proof</strong> (using Plonk or a similar
                protocol with KZG commitments). This final SNARK proof
                is what gets verified on Ethereum L1. The
                rationale:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> STARKs excel at
                parallelizable computation and avoid trusted setups for
                the core proving work.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Succinctness:</strong> Wrapping the
                potentially larger STARK proof in a SNARK minimizes the
                on-chain verification gas cost.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The modular design
                allows components to be upgraded independently.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Integration with Polygon CDK and
                AggLayer:</strong> Polygon zkEVM’s true power lies in
                its role as the flagship within Polygon’s expansive
                ecosystem strategy:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon Chain Development Kit
                (CDK):</strong> This open-source toolkit enables any
                project to launch its own <strong>ZK-powered Layer 2 or
                Layer 3</strong> blockchain using Polygon’s proven
                technology stack. CDK chains are configurable but
                inherently Type-2 (or Type-3) ZK-EVMs, ensuring Ethereum
                compatibility. Examples include <strong>Immutable
                zkEVM</strong> (gaming), <strong>Astar zkEVM</strong>
                (Japan focus), and <strong>Manta Network</strong>
                (modular ecosystem). CDK democratizes ZK-EVM
                deployment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>AggLayer (Aggregation Layer):</strong>
                Launched in February 2024, the AggLayer solves a
                critical challenge: fragmented liquidity and complex
                bridging between the multitude of ZK chains (both the
                Polygon zkEVM and CDK chains). It acts as a
                <strong>unified hub for cross-chain
                interoperability</strong>:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unified Bridge:</strong> Provides a
                single, secure bridge endpoint to Ethereum L1 for all
                connected chains.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Near-Instant Atomic
                Composability:</strong> Leverages zero-knowledge proofs,
                the AggLayer enables atomic transactions spanning
                multiple connected chains. For example, swapping a token
                on Chain A for a token on Chain B and an NFT on Chain C
                in a single atomic operation, settled within seconds,
                without relying on third-party bridges or wrapped
                assets. This is achieved by aggregating state proofs
                from multiple chains and enabling synchronous
                cross-chain messaging secured by ZKPs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unified Liquidity Pool:</strong> Allows
                liquidity deposited into the AggLayer to be accessible
                across all connected chains, dramatically improving
                capital efficiency. The Type-2 Polygon zkEVM serves as
                the anchor and proving powerhouse for this
                interconnected “Value Layer.” Its robust infrastructure
                and Type-2 equivalence ensure seamless integration and
                security for the entire ecosystem.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Strategic Tradeoffs: Speed Optimizations
                and Ecosystem Leverage:</strong> Polygon’s path to
                Type-2 involved calculated tradeoffs distinct from
                Scroll’s purism:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance First (Initially):</strong>
                Launching first as Type-3 allowed Polygon to achieve
                higher TPS and faster finality earlier, capturing
                developer mindshare and onboarding major dApps like
                <strong>Aave</strong> and <strong>Balancer</strong> even
                before full equivalence. The subsequent upgrade to
                Type-2 minimized disruption for these early
                adopters.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Leveraging Existing Scale:</strong>
                Polygon benefited immensely from its established PoS
                sidechain ecosystem. Existing relationships with
                developers, projects, and users provided a ready-made
                audience and deployment pipeline for its zkEVM. Tools
                like the <strong>Polygon Portal</strong> offered a
                familiar interface.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hybrid Proofs for Efficiency:</strong>
                The SNARK-wrapped-STARK approach was chosen explicitly
                to maximize prover throughput and minimize end-to-end
                latency compared to pure SNARK-based approaches,
                accepting the architectural complexity. This aligned
                with the need for high performance within the
                AggLayer.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Centralization for Launch Speed:</strong>
                Similar to others, Polygon zkEVM launched with a
                centralized sequencer operated by Polygon Labs, enabling
                rapid iteration and optimization during the critical
                early mainnet phase. Decentralization of sequencing and
                proving is an active part of its roadmap.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Polygon zkEVM demonstrates how Type-2 equivalence can
                be strategically leveraged not just for a single chain,
                but as the foundation for an entire ecosystem of
                scalable, interconnected blockchains, positioning itself
                as a central pillar in Ethereum’s multi-layered
                future.</p>

                <p>Taiko emerged with a distinct architectural

                censorship resistance from day one, while steadfastly
                adhering to the Type-2 equivalence standard. Its “based

                represent bold experiments in ZK-Rollup design.</p>

                <li><strong>Based Rollups: Inheriting L1 Finality and
                Censorship Resistance:</strong> Taiko’s most radical
                departure is eliminating the concept of a dedicated,
                potentially centralized, sequencer. Instead, it directly
                leverages <strong>Ethereum’s block proposers
                (builders)</strong>:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>L1 Block Proposers as
                Sequencers:</strong> Anyone proposing an Ethereum L1
                block can choose to include a Taiko L2 block as part of
                their L1 block proposal. The Taiko block’s transactions
                are ordered and embedded within the L1 block
                data.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Inheriting L1 Properties:</strong> This
                design means Taiko <strong>inherits Ethereum L1’s
                liveness and censorship resistance directly</strong>.
                The economic incentives for L1 proposers to include
                profitable transactions (including Taiko blocks) ensure
                Taiko blocks are produced reliably. Censoring Taiko
                transactions would require colluding to censor
                transactions on Ethereum L1 itself, a significantly
                higher barrier. This “<strong>based</strong>”
                nomenclature signifies that Taiko derives its sequencing
                security directly from the base layer (L1).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proposer Incentives:</strong> L1
                proposers are compensated for including Taiko blocks via
                priority fees and MEV captured within the L2 block,
                similar to how they profit from L1 transactions. Taiko’s
                protocol ensures this compensation is verifiable and
                fair.</p></li>

                Taiko block is proposed on L1, nodes in the Taiko
                network download it. They execute the transactions
                (using a <strong>slightly modified Geth client</strong>
                for Type-2 equivalence) and generate the execution
                trace. Provers then generate ZK proofs for the block’s

                <strong>ZK-SNARK validity proofs</strong> (using a
                Halo2-based circuit, similar to Scroll) for Taiko
                blocks. They earn rewards for successful proof
                generation. This is the bedrock of cryptographic
                security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Guardian Provers (Diverse Tech):</strong>
                Operating in parallel, Guardian Provers provide an
                additional layer of security and liveness using
                potentially different technologies. The initial
                implementation leverages <strong>Intel SGX (Software
                Guard Extensions)</strong> secure enclaves:</p></li>
                <li><p>An SGX enclave is a hardware-isolated,
                tamper-resistant environment within a CPU.</p></li>
                <li><p>Guardian Provers run a verified Taiko node
                <em>inside</em> an SGX enclave.</p></li>
                <li><p>The enclave attests to the correctness of the
                node software and its execution.</p></li>
                <li><p>It produces a <strong>cryptographic
                attestation</strong> proving that it executed the Taiko
                block correctly given the inputs (the L1 block data
                containing the Taiko block and the previous L2
                state).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Purpose of Guardians:</strong></p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Liveness During ZK Proving
                Bootstrapping:</strong> If the ZK proving network is
                slow, overloaded, or experiences technical issues,
                Guardian proofs provide a temporary, cryptographically
                secured attestation of validity, allowing the system to
                progress without waiting for the potentially slower ZK
                proof. This prevents denial-of-service via prover
                failure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Censorship Resistance:</strong> If ZK
                provers are censored or refuse to prove valid blocks (a
                malicious scenario), Guardian provers can still attest
                to validity, ensuring censorship-resistant
                progression.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Diversity:</strong> SGX relies
                on hardware security and remote attestation, a different
                trust model than pure cryptographic ZKPs. While SGX has
                its own attack surface (side-channels, potential
                vulnerabilities), it provides diversification, reducing
                systemic risk. Taiko envisions supporting other Guardian
                proof types (e.g., based on different ZK systems or
                trusted hardware) in the future.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>ZK as the Gold Standard:</strong>
                Crucially, ZK proofs remain the ultimate source of
                truth. Guardian proofs are designed as a temporary or
                fallback mechanism. The system incentivizes and
                prioritizes ZK proofs whenever available. Guardian
                proofs act as a robust safety net during the ecosystem’s
                maturation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Contestable Rollups for Anti-Censorship
                Guarantees:</strong> Taiko incorporates a layer of
                <strong>optimistic verification</strong> on top of its
                validity proofs to further bolster censorship
                resistance:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> While validity
                proofs <em>should</em> make invalid state transitions
                impossible, a scenario exists where a malicious actor
                controlling block production (an L1 proposer in Taiko’s
                case) could theoretically <em>refuse to include a valid
                transaction</em> (censorship) or even try to include an
                invalid block (though this should be caught by
                provers).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Contestation Mechanism:</strong> Taiko
                allows any participant (a “<strong>prover</strong>” or
                “<strong>challenger</strong>”) to
                <strong>contest</strong> a proposed L2 state transition
                <em>before</em> it’s finalized on L1. If a block is
                contested:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p>An interactive fraud proof game is initiated on
                L1 (similar to Optimistic Rollups, but shorter
                duration).</p></li>
                <li><p>The contested block’s execution is bisected down
                to a single disputed opcode step.</p></li>
                <li><p>This single step is executed on-chain on Ethereum
                L1.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If the contestation is
                proven correct (the block was invalid), the malicious
                proposer is slashed, and the invalid block is rejected.
                If the contestation is wrong, the challenger is slashed.
                This mechanism economically disincentivizes censorship
                (proposers risk getting slashed if they exclude valid
                transactions that could later be proven valid in a
                contest) and provides a final backstop against any
                potential, unforeseen flaw in the ZK proof system or
                Guardian proofs that might allow an invalid block to
                slip through.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-2 Fidelity and Permissionless
                Proving:</strong> Underpinning these innovations is a
                core commitment to Type-2 equivalence. Taiko utilizes a
                modified Geth client, passes Ethereum’s execution tests,
                and supports deploying unmodified L1 bytecode. Its
                Halo2-based prover is designed for permissionless
                participation, allowing anyone with suitable hardware to
                join the proving network and earn rewards. The
                <strong>Katla</strong> testnet and subsequent
                <strong>Eldfell</strong> L3 (on Sepolia) served as
                extensive proving grounds before the <strong>mainnet
                alpha “Grímsvötn”</strong> launch in early
                2024.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Taiko represents a high-risk, high-reward approach to
                Type-2. Its based sequencing and multi-proof model push
                the boundaries of decentralization and liveness
                guarantees but introduce significant complexity and
                reliance on technologies like SGX with their own
                security considerations. Its success hinges on proving
                this complexity is manageable and delivers tangible
                security advantages.</p>

                Performance Benchmarks &amp; Resource Consumption</h3>
                <p>The theoretical advantages of Type-2 ZK-EVMs must be
                measured against concrete performance metrics. As of
                mid-2024, the landscape reveals significant progress
                alongside ongoing challenges, with distinct profiles
                emerging for each major implementation. Benchmarks are
                inherently volatile, rapidly improving with software
                optimizations and hardware advancements, but provide
                crucial snapshots for comparison.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Transactions Per Second (TPS) Under
                Identical Workloads:</strong> Throughput is a key
                scaling promise. Comparisons require standardized
                workloads (e.g., simple ETH transfers, ERC-20 transfers,
                Uniswap V3 swaps).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Early Mainnet Realities (Q1
                2024):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM (Type-2 Config):</strong>
                Leveraging its hybrid STARK-SNARK prover and GPU
                acceleration, Polygon typically demonstrated the highest
                sustained TPS among the pure Type-2s, often ranging
                between <strong>50-100+ TPS</strong> for mixed workloads
                during peak demand. Its architecture prioritized
                throughput from the outset.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taiko:</strong> Benefiting from its based
                sequencing (inheriting L1 block times) and focus on
                prover network scalability, Taiko also achieved high
                throughput, frequently reported in the <strong>40-80+
                TPS</strong> range in its alpha phase, with ambitions
                for higher figures.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll:</strong> Reflecting its initial
                focus on equivalence and open-source proving, Scroll’s
                mainnet launch saw more modest throughput, typically
                <strong>10-20 TPS</strong> sustained. This was a
                conscious trade-off, prioritizing stability and
                correctness. Aggressive optimizations (parallel witness
                gen, GPU acceleration integration) were rolled out
                steadily post-launch, significantly improving this
                figure by mid-2024.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Bottleneck: Proof
                Generation:</strong> For all Type-2 ZK-EVMs, TPS is
                fundamentally constrained by the time and computational
                cost to generate the ZK validity proof for a batch of
                transactions. Larger batches amortize the fixed L1
                verification cost per transaction but take longer to
                prove. Projects continuously tune batch sizes and
                proving strategies for optimal throughput vs. latency.
                <strong>All implementations achieved orders of magnitude
                higher TPS than Ethereum L1 (~15 TPS).</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact of Workload:</strong> TPS varies
                dramatically with transaction complexity. A batch of
                simple transfers proves much faster than a batch
                containing numerous complex DeFi interactions or heavy
                precompile usage (like many <code>KECCAK</code>
                operations). Polygon’s STARK prover generally handled
                compute-heavy batches more efficiently than pure SNARK
                approaches at this stage.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Prover Hardware Requirements: The Cost of
                Trustlessness:</strong> Generating ZK proofs for EVM
                execution is computationally intensive, demanding
                specialized hardware:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>GPU Dominance (NVIDIA
                A100/H100):</strong> The workhorses of ZK proving. All
                major Type-2 provers leverage high-end server-grade GPUs
                for massively parallel computation, particularly for
                witness generation (executing the trace) and the
                polynomial calculations central to SNARKs/STARKs. A
                single server might house 4-8+ GPUs. <strong>Polygon
                zkEVM’s</strong> STARK prover is particularly optimized
                for GPU parallelism. <strong>Scroll</strong> and
                <strong>Taiko’s</strong> Halo2 provers also heavily
                utilize GPUs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The ASIC/FPGA Frontier:</strong> To push
                performance and efficiency further, specialized hardware
                is emerging:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate
                Arrays):</strong> Offer potential speedups for specific,
                fixed components of the proving pipeline (e.g., MSM -
                Multi-Scalar Multiplication in SNARKs, Keccak hashing).
                Projects like <strong>Ingonyama</strong> develop FPGA
                libraries. Provers might integrate FPGA accelerators
                into GPU servers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated
                Circuits):</strong> Represent the ultimate
                specialization but require massive upfront investment
                and long development cycles. Companies like
                <strong>Cysic</strong> are developing ZK-accelerating
                ASICs targeting operations like NTT (Number Theoretic
                Transform) and polynomial multiplication. While not yet
                mainstream in production Type-2 provers, ASICs promise
                order-of-magnitude efficiency gains in the coming years.
                Taiko has expressed interest in ASIC integration for its
                prover network.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cost Implications:</strong> The high cost
                of prover hardware (thousands of dollars per GPU, much
                more for large clusters or ASICs) translates into
                proving costs that must be covered by transaction fees.
                This creates an economic barrier to permissionless
                proving participation, favoring large-scale professional
                proving operations initially. Projects are actively
                working on proof aggregation markets (e.g.,
                <strong>Ulvetanna</strong>, <strong>Gevulot</strong>) to
                distribute work efficiently and lower barriers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>End-to-End Latency: The User Experience
                Factor:</strong> Beyond raw TPS, the time from a user
                submitting a transaction to achieving <strong>full L1
                finality</strong> (irreversible confirmation via proof
                verification on Ethereum) is critical for user
                experience. This “time to finality” (TTF)
                encompasses:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Sequencing/Inclusion Time:</strong> Time
                for the sequencer (centralized or L1 proposer) to
                include the transaction in an L2 block.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Execution &amp; Witness
                Generation:</strong> Time for the node to execute the
                transaction and generate the witness data for the
                prover.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Generation:</strong> The dominant
                latency component – time for the prover network to
                generate the ZK proof for the batch containing the
                transaction. This can range from seconds for small
                batches of simple txns to many minutes for large,
                complex batches.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Verification &amp;
                Confirmation:</strong> Time to post the batch proof to
                Ethereum L1 and have it verified and confirmed (subject
                to L1 block times, ~12 seconds avg.).</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Mid-2024 Latency Benchmarks (Typical
                Averages):</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM:</strong> ~10-20 minutes
                TTF. Its hybrid prover and performance focus yielded the
                lowest latency among Type-2s.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taiko:</strong> ~15-25 minutes TTF. Based
                sequencing minimized step (1), but proving times were
                comparable to Scroll/Taiko’s own ZK prover.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll:</strong> ~30-60+ minutes TTF
                initially; improved significantly with optimizations to
                ~20-40 minutes by mid-2024. Proof generation remained
                the primary bottleneck.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Soft Confirmations:</strong> To improve
                user experience, all chains provide “soft confirmations”
                almost instantly after sequencing – indicating the
                transaction is included on L2 and <em>very likely</em>
                final, pending proof verification. For most users, this
                feels near-instantaneous. However, protocols handling
                high-value transactions or cross-chain interactions
                often wait for full L1 finality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Resource Consumption &amp;
                Sustainability:</strong> The energy footprint of
                large-scale ZK proving farms is an emerging
                concern:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>High Power Draw:</strong> Server racks
                filled with high-end GPUs consume significant
                electricity. A single prover server might draw 2-5 kW or
                more under load.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Benchmarking Efficiency:</strong>
                Projects and researchers are starting to measure and
                compare <strong>proofs per Joule</strong> (energy
                efficiency) and <strong>proofs per second per
                Watt</strong>. These metrics will become increasingly
                important for cost and environmental
                sustainability.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Future Optimizations:</strong>
                ASICs/FPGAs promise drastic efficiency improvements
                (potentially 10-100x). Algorithmic advancements (e.g.,
                more efficient arithmetization, better lookup arguments)
                also reduce computational overhead. The long-term trend
                points towards significantly lower energy consumption
                per proven transaction.</p></li>

                witnessing relentless innovation. As optimizations
                mature and specialized hardware proliferates, the
                performance gap between Type-2 and less equivalent types
                (Type-3/4) is expected to shrink significantly,
                strengthening the case for bytecode-level fidelity as
                the optimal balance for Ethereum scaling.</p>

                <p>The dazzling performance benchmarks and seamless
                developer experiences chronicled in Section 5 rest upon
                a formidable foundation of cryptographic guarantees.
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs inherit Ethereum’s bedrock security
                through validity proofs – mathematical assertions that
                state transitions are correct, verified on-chain with
                ironclad certainty. Yet beneath this elegant veneer lies
                a complex tapestry of trust assumptions, potential
                vulnerabilities, and adversarial pressures. As billions
                in value flow through these nascent systems,
                understanding their security model isn’t academic; it’s
                existential. This section dissects the intricate
                security architecture of Type-2 ZK-EVMs, scrutinizing
                the cryptographic bedrock, the relentless pursuit of
                prover correctness, and the often-overlooked challenges
                of data availability and censorship resistance. We move
                beyond the allure of “inherited L1 security” to expose
                the nuanced realities securing Ethereum’s scaling
                frontier.</p>

                Trusted Setup Ceremonies &amp; Cryptographic
                Assumptions</h3>
                <p>The cryptographic magic of ZK-SNARKs relies on
                intricate mathematical machinery. For Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                leveraging proof systems like Plonk with KZG polynomial
                commitments (used by Scroll and Taiko), a critical
                ritual precedes their operation: the <strong>Trusted
                Setup Ceremony</strong>. This process generates the
                foundational public parameters (Common Reference String
                - CRS) required for proving and verification. Its
                integrity is paramount; a single point of failure could
                compromise the entire system.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Peril of “Toxic Waste”:</strong> The
                core vulnerability stems from the need to generate
                secret random values during setup. If <em>any</em>
                participant retains these secrets (the “toxic waste”),
                they gain the catastrophic ability to forge fake
                validity proofs. An attacker could “prove” invalid state
                transitions – minting infinite tokens, draining vaults,
                or corrupting the state root – while the L1 verifier
                contract would accept them as valid. This represents a
                total breakdown of the system’s security
                promise.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Powers-of-Tau: The Multi-Party
                Salvation:</strong> To mitigate this
                single-point-of-failure risk, modern ZK-EVMs rely on
                <strong>multi-party computation (MPC)
                ceremonies</strong>, specifically the
                <strong>Powers-of-Tau</strong> framework. Imagine a
                relay race where participants sequentially contribute to
                the setup:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Initialization:</strong> A first
                participant generates initial parameters and a secret
                <code>τ</code> (tau), computes the first set of
                cryptographic elements
                (<code>[τ^0]G, [τ^1]G, ..., [τ^{n-1}]G</code> for a
                group generator <code>G</code>), and destroys
                <code>τ</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequential Contribution:</strong> A new
                participant receives the current parameters. They
                generate a fresh secret <code>s</code>, update the
                parameters by exponentiating them with <code>s</code>
                (effectively transforming <code>τ</code> to
                <code>τ * s</code>), and then destroys <code>s</code>.
                This updates the CRS without revealing the cumulative
                secret.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Attestation &amp; Verification:</strong>
                Each participant cryptographically attests to their
                contribution and the destruction of their secret. Public
                tools allow anyone to verify the correctness of the
                transformation at each step.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Final Output:</strong> After many
                participants, the final CRS is published. The cumulative
                secret <code>τ_final = τ * s1 * s2 * ... * sN</code> is
                known to <em>no one</em>, provided at least one
                participant destroyed their <code>s_i</code>
                honestly.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The security model shifts: trust isn’t placed in a
                single entity, but in the belief that <em>at least one
                participant</em> among potentially thousands acted
                honestly and destroyed their secret.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Landmark Ceremonies &amp; Scaling
                Challenges:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Perpetual Powers of Tau:</strong>
                Spearheaded by the Ethereum Foundation and Privacy &amp;
                Scaling Explorations (PSE) group, this ongoing ceremony
                started in 2019. By mid-2024, it boasted <strong>over
                100,000 contributions</strong>, becoming the de facto
                standard for numerous ZK projects, including
                <strong>Scroll</strong> and <strong>Taiko</strong>. Its
                longevity and massive participation create an immense
                “honeypot” for attackers – compromising it would break
                countless systems, making it both a high-value target
                and a highly resilient one due to its scale and
                transparency. Contributors range from core developers
                like Vitalik Buterin and Justin Drake to anonymous
                individuals using Tor browsers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Project-Specific Ceremonies:</strong>
                Some projects, like <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong> (for
                its SNARK components), conducted dedicated ceremonies.
                Polygon’s 2022 ceremony attracted over 5,000
                participants, including prominent figures like Sandeep
                Nailwal (Polygon co-founder) and Brendan Farmer
                (co-founder of Polygon Zero). While smaller than the
                Perpetual ceremony, these focused efforts ensured
                tailored parameters and fostered community engagement.
                Verification tools allowed public auditing of
                contributions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Ceremony Completion”
                Paradox:</strong> A subtle vulnerability exists
                <em>after</em> the ceremony ends. The entity publishing
                the final CRS <em>could</em> potentially have
                manipulated it if they intercepted contributions or
                colluded with participants. Mitigations
                involve:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Delayed Finalization:</strong> Announcing
                the ceremony end date far in advance, allowing a surge
                of last-minute contributions to dilute potential
                malice.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Multi-Party Publication:</strong>
                Requiring signatures from multiple geographically
                dispersed entities to release the final CRS.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transparent Tooling:</strong> Open-source
                software for contribution and verification minimizes
                reliance on any single implementation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>STARKs vs. SNARKs: The Post-Quantum
                Crucible:</strong> While SNARKs (like Plonk) dominate
                Type-2 implementations due to smaller proof sizes and
                lower L1 verification gas costs, <strong>Polygon
                zkEVM’s</strong> core reliance on STARKs highlights a
                key security distinction: <strong>trusted setup
                vs. post-quantum resilience</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>STARKs: Transparent but Bulky:</strong>
                STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge)
                require <em>no trusted setup</em>. Their security rests
                solely on collision-resistant hash functions (like
                SHA-2/3) and information-theoretic properties. This
                eliminates the toxic waste risk entirely. Crucially,
                hash-based cryptography is widely believed to be
                <strong>resistant to attacks by future quantum
                computers</strong>. However, STARK proofs are
                significantly larger (tens of kilobytes vs. &lt;2 KB for
                SNARKs), leading to higher L1 verification gas
                costs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>SNARKs: Efficient but
                Quantum-Vulnerable:</strong> SNARKs rely on the hardness
                of problems like the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
                Problem (ECDLP) over curves like BN254 or BLS12-381.
                While secure against classical computers, <strong>ECDLP
                is efficiently solvable by sufficiently large quantum
                computers</strong> using Shor’s algorithm. A
                cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) could
                forge SNARK proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Hybrid Hedge &amp; Migration
                Paths:</strong> Polygon zkEVM’s architecture – using a
                STARK prover internally and wrapping it in a SNARK for
                efficient L1 verification – strategically hedges against
                quantum threats. The core computational integrity proof
                is quantum-resistant. Only the final SNARK wrapper is
                vulnerable, and migrating to a quantum-resistant SNARK
                (e.g., based on lattices or hash-based commitments) or
                directly verifying the STARK on L1 (if gas costs become
                acceptable) is a viable long-term path. SNARK-only
                chains like Scroll and Taiko actively research
                <strong>post-quantum secure SNARKs</strong> using
                alternative mathematical foundations, acknowledging
                quantum vulnerability as a long-term, albeit currently
                theoretical, risk that necessitates forward planning.
                The debate continues: Is the immediacy of lower fees
                (SNARKs) worth the long-term quantum risk versus the
                higher fees but quantum safety of pure STARKs?</p></li>

                for secure key generation, storage, and use. They:</p>

                <li><p><strong>Prevent Key Extraction:</strong> Keys
                never leave the HSM’s secure boundary. Operations are
                performed internally.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Enforce Access Control:</strong> Require
                multi-factor authentication for critical

                <p>Leading Type-2 providers like <strong>Scroll,
                Polygon, and Taiko</strong> utilize HSMs (e.g., from
                Thales or AWS CloudHSM) to protect sequencer keys during
                their centralized phases. As they decentralize, the risk
                shifts to individual validator/prover nodes securing
                their keys appropriately, though HSMs remain the gold
                standard for high-value operators. The <strong>Coinbase
                exchange hack (2021)</strong>, where an employee’s
                laptop compromise led to API key theft, underscores why
                HSMs are non-negotiable for foundational infrastructure
                keys.</p>
                <p>The cryptographic foundation of Type-2 ZK-EVMs is a
                carefully constructed edifice of distributed trust
                (Powers-of-Tau), algorithmic choices balancing
                efficiency and future threats (SNARKs vs. STARKs), and
                physical security (HSMs). Yet, this foundation only
                guarantees that <em>if</em> the prover software
                functions correctly, valid proofs will be generated and
                accepted. The integrity of the prover itself is the next
                critical layer.</p>

                <p>The prover is the most complex and security-critical
                component of a Type-2 ZK-EVM. It translates EVM
                execution traces into cryptographic validity proofs. A

                an off-by-one error in witness generation, or an
                incorrect handling of an edge-case opcode – can create a
                <strong>soundness bug</strong>. This catastrophic
                vulnerability allows a malicious actor to generate a

                (2019):</strong> In a non-EVM but highly relevant case,
                a subtle error in the Sapling circuit (based on BCTV14
                SNARKs) allowed the creation of fake spends without
                valid spend authority. Discovered by the Zcash team
                during an audit, this “Jubjub” bug could have enabled
                infinite counterfeiting. It was fixed before
                exploitation, highlighting the critical importance of
                circuit audits. The fix required a hard fork and a new

                vulnerability in the original Hermez (a precursor to
                Polygon zkEVM) PIL (Polynomial Identity Language)
                compiler. A flaw could allow a prover to skip
                constraints under specific conditions, potentially
                enabling invalid state transitions. The bug was fixed
                before mainnet deployment.</p></li>

                Auditors identified a vulnerability in zkSync Era’s

                allowed an attacker to withdraw unbacked funds under
                specific multi-transaction scenarios. Fixed before
                exploitation. This underscores that security extends

                While many resolved bugs remain confidential due to NDAs
                and ongoing risks, the scale of these bounties
                demonstrates their importance. The absence of major
                exploits on production Type-2 mainnets (as of mid-2024)
                is partly attributable to this robust incentivized
                scrutiny. The <strong>$10 million bounty paid by Polygon
                for a vulnerability in its Plasma bridge in
                2021</strong> (pre-zkEVM) set a precedent for the value

                <p>The relentless pursuit of prover correctness –
                through formal methods, exhaustive audits, adversarial
                testing, and massive bounties – forms the intellectual
                fortress protecting Type-2 ZK-EVMs. However,
                cryptographic soundness alone isn’t sufficient. The
                practical security model hinges crucially on data
                availability and censorship resistance, ensuring users

                <p>Type-2 ZK-EVMs derive their security from Ethereum
                L1, but this dependency creates unique availability and
                censorship vectors. The oft-repeated “inherits L1
                security” mantra requires careful qualification
                regarding how data is managed and who controls
                transaction inclusion.</p>

                <li><p><strong>The Rollup vs. Validium
                Spectrum:</strong> A core security distinction centers
                on <strong>Data Availability (DA)</strong>:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-Rollups (True Type-2):</strong> These
                systems, like <strong>Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, and
                Taiko</strong>, post <strong>all essential transaction
                data (calldata)</strong> to Ethereum L1 in a compressed
                format alongside the validity proof and state root. This
                ensures:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Reconstruction:</strong> Anyone can
                download the L1 data and reconstruct the entire L2 state
                history independently.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Permissionless Exits:</strong> Users can
                cryptographically prove their L2 balance directly to an
                L1 withdrawal contract using Merkle proofs derived from
                the available data, even if the L2 operators vanish or
                become hostile. This is the gold standard for
                decentralization and user sovereignty.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cost:</strong> Posting data to L1 is the
                dominant cost component for users (often 60-80% of the
                L2 transaction fee). Proto-danksharding (EIP-4844)
                introduced <strong>blobs</strong> to significantly
                reduce this cost while maintaining DA
                guarantees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-Validiums (Not Typically
                Type-2):</strong> These systems post <em>only</em> the
                state root and validity proof to L1. The transaction
                data is stored off-chain by a committee or a
                decentralized network (like Celestia, EigenDA, or
                Polygon Avail). While drastically cheaper, this
                introduces a critical risk: <strong>If the DA layer
                fails or censors the data, users cannot prove their
                state and withdraw their assets.</strong> While some
                projects explore validium modes for specific
                high-throughput applications, leading Type-2
                implementations prioritize the robust security model of
                true rollups using Ethereum for DA. <strong>Polygon
                CDK</strong> offers validium as a <em>configurable
                option</em> for chains using its stack, but the flagship
                Polygon zkEVM chain itself operates as a
                rollup.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralizing the Sequencer: The
                Censorship Battlefield:</strong> The sequencer is the
                gatekeeper, ordering transactions into blocks.
                Centralized sequencers (the launch state for Scroll and
                Polygon zkEVM) present a single point of

                <li><p><strong>Censorship Vectors:</strong> A malicious
                or coerced sequencer could:</p></li>

                sanctioned entities, competitors).</p></li>
                <li><p>Front-run or sandwich user transactions for MEV
                extraction.</p></li>

                Decentralization:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Validator Sets
                (Scroll, Polygon zkEVM):</strong> Both projects plan to
                transition to permissionless networks of staked
                validators who take turns proposing blocks. Mechanisms
                like <strong>Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)</strong>
                or <strong>randomized leader election</strong> prevent
                predictable manipulation. <strong>Slashing</strong>
                penalizes validators for censorship (e.g., skipping
                valid transactions) or liveness failures.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Based Sequencing (Taiko):</strong> As
                detailed in Section 5, Taiko uniquely leverages
                <strong>Ethereum L1 block proposers (builders)</strong>
                as its sequencers. This inherits L1’s strong censorship
                resistance – censoring Taiko transactions requires
                colluding to censor L1 transactions, a vastly harder
                proposition. L1 proposers are economically incentivized
                to include profitable Taiko blocks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Force Inclusion Mechanisms:</strong> A
                crucial safety net. Even in decentralized systems, a
                temporary cartel could attempt censorship. Force
                inclusion allows users to:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p>Submit a transaction directly to a special L1
                contract.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pay an L1 gas fee.</p></li>
                <li><p>Have the transaction included in the
                <em>next</em> L2 block after a short delay (e.g., 24

                <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong> implements this via its
                <code>PolygonZkEVM.sol</code> L1 contract.
                <strong>Scroll and Taiko</strong> have similar
                mechanisms in their roadmaps or implementations. This
                ensures users always have an escape hatch.</p></li>

                Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) – profit extracted by
                reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions – isn’t
                eliminated by ZK proofs; it’s transformed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequencer-Controlled MEV:</strong> A
                centralized sequencer has complete control over
                transaction ordering, making MEV extraction trivial and
                highly centralized. Decentralized sequencer networks
                need fair ordering mechanisms.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-MEV Solutions:</strong> Emerging
                approaches include:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Auctions (MEVA):</strong> Sequencers
                (or block builders in a decentralized network) compete
                in auctions for the right to build a block, committing
                to share MEV revenue with the protocol or stakers.
                Proposers choose the most profitable bid.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fair Sequencing Services (FSS):</strong>
                Techniques like <strong>threshold encryption</strong>
                (e.g., using SGX in <strong>Taiko’s Guardian
                Provers</strong> or <strong>Chainlink FSS</strong>) hide
                transaction content until after the block is ordered,
                preventing front-running. The sequencer orders based on
                encrypted timestamps or random shuffling.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>SUAVE (Single Unified Auction for Value
                Expression):</strong> A shared decentralized mempool and
                block builder network, allowing users to express MEV
                preferences cross-chain, potentially reducing the
                sequencer’s edge. Type-2 ZK-EVMs can integrate with
                SUAVE-compatible builders.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Privacy Paradox:</strong> ZK proofs
                hide computation details, but transaction data (sender,
                recipient, amount, calldata) is typically public on L1
                for rollups. Truly hiding MEV opportunities requires
                further privacy layers, potentially leveraging ZKPs
                themselves for transaction confidentiality (e.g.,
                Aztec’s approach, though not Type-2).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Prover Endgame:</strong> While
                decentralization focuses on sequencers, the prover role
                also needs scaling. Centralized proving creates liveness
                risks and potential central points of failure.
                <strong>Permissionless Prover Networks</strong> (planned
                by Scroll, Taiko, and evolving for Polygon) aim to
                create competitive markets:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Markets (Gevulot,
                Ulvetanna):</strong> Platforms where provers bid to
                generate proofs for blocks or batches. This distributes
                work, reduces costs, and prevents censorship <em>of
                proof generation itself</em> – if one prover refuses or
                is attacked, others can step in.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Diversity:</strong> Supporting
                GPU, FPGA, and eventually ASIC provers prevents
                centralization around specific hardware monopolies and
                enhances network resilience. <strong>Taiko’s
                multi-prover model</strong> (ZK + SGX Guardians)
                exemplifies redundancy for liveness.</p></li>

                <p>The security of Type-2 ZK-EVMs is a multi-dimensional
                challenge. It extends from the abstract purity of
                cryptographic assumptions and mathematical proofs to the
                gritty realities of data storage, key management, and
                the game theory of decentralized sequencing. While
                validity proofs provide an unprecedented guarantee of
                state correctness, the practical security – ensuring
                users can always access their assets and participate
                without censorship – hinges on robust data availability
                and thoughtfully designed, progressively decentralized
                operational mechanisms. It’s a continuous evolution,
                balancing the ideal of trust minimization with the

                <p>The intricate cryptographic machinery and
                decentralized security models dissected in Section 6
                serve a singular purpose: enabling developers to build
                transformative applications. For Type-2 ZK-EVMs, the
                ultimate litmus test lies not in theoretical elegance,
                but in the pragmatic realities of the builder
                experience. Does this revolutionary scaling technology
                truly deliver on its promise of frictionless adoption
                for Ethereum’s vast developer base? Or does it introduce
                hidden complexities that fracture workflows and stifle
                innovation? This section ventures into the trenches of
                decentralized application development, scrutinizing the
                migration journey for seasoned Solidity engineers, the
                emergence of novel ZK-native tooling, and the hard-won
                lessons from pioneering protocols that dared to deploy
                first. The narrative unfolding reveals a landscape where
                remarkable seamlessness coexists with unique challenges,
                forging a new paradigm for scalable smart contract
                development.</p>

                <p>The cornerstone of Type-2’s value proposition is its
                unwavering commitment to <strong>bytecode-level
                equivalence</strong>. This translates into a powerful
                promise for developers: existing Ethereum dApps,
                battle-tested and audited, should deploy and function
                identically on a Type-2 L2 <em>without a single line of
                code change</em>. The practical realization of this
                promise hinges on deep, unobtrusive integration with the
                tools Ethereum developers already wield daily.</p>

                Developers interact with Type-2 chains almost
                identically to Ethereum mainnet or testnets. The core

                <li><p><strong>Write:</strong> Code in Solidity/Vyper
                using familiar IDEs (VSCode with Solidity plugins,
                Remix).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Compile:</strong> Use standard compilers
                (<code>solc</code>, <code>vyper</code>) with identical
                settings and optimization levels. <em>No custom ZK
                compiler is needed.</em> The output is standard EVM
                bytecode.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Test:</strong> Run unit and integration
                tests using <code>forge test</code> (Foundry) or
                <code>npx hardhat test</code> against a local node
                (e.g., Scroll’s <code>scroll-node</code>, Polygon
                zkEVM’s local setup, Taiko’s <code>taiko-node</code>) or
                a public L2 testnet.</p></li>

                endpoint. Addresses, contract storage layouts, and
                constructor arguments work identically.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Interact:</strong> Use <code>cast</code>

                <li><p><strong>Case Validation: SushiSwap on
                Scroll:</strong> When SushiSwap deployed its core
                <code>UniswapV2Factory</code> and
                <code>UniswapV2Router02</code> contracts to Scroll
                mainnet, engineers reported the process was
                indistinguishable from deploying to Arbitrum or
                Optimism. The existing Hardhat deployment scripts,
                designed for EVM chains, executed flawlessly against
                Scroll’s RPC. The factory correctly deployed pair
                contracts, and swaps executed with identical logic and
                fee structures. “It felt like deploying to yet another
                EVM chain, not some exotic ZK system,” noted a lead
                Sushi developer.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Debugging: Local Proof Generation &amp;
                The State Sync Imperative:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Local Network Nuances:</strong> While
                Foundry’s <code>forge test</code> runs seamlessly
                against a local Type-2 node (e.g.,
                <code>scroll-node</code>), debugging complex failures
                requires understanding the ZK stack’s added layer.
                Simply re-running transactions locally doesn’t
                inherently generate a ZK proof – it only simulates EVM
                execution.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Local Proving for Deep
                Debugging:</strong> To debug issues <em>specific to the
                proving process</em> (e.g., a constraint violation
                causing a valid execution trace to fail proof
                generation), developers need to generate proofs
                locally:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll Local Environment:</strong>
                Includes the <code>scroll-prover</code> component.
                Running <code>scroll-node</code> and
                <code>scroll-prover</code> locally allows developers to
                execute a transaction <em>and</em> generate a proof
                against it within their development environment.
                Debugging involves tracing why a specific opcode
                sequence or state change caused the constraint system to
                fail.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM Local Setup:</strong>
                Requires running the <code>zkevm-prover</code> alongside
                the node. The prover’s detailed logs (especially for
                STARK stages) become crucial when an execution that
                passes Geth simulation fails during proving, often
                pinpointing discrepancies in precompile emulation or gas
                accounting.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State Synchronization
                Challenges:</strong> A critical pain point emerged
                during early migrations: <strong>differing initial
                states between L1 and L2</strong>. Contracts relying on
                specific pre-deployed addresses (e.g., the WETH contract
                at
                <code>0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2</code>)
                or complex L1 state (like ENS records) could fail if the
                L2 environment didn’t mirror this state precisely.
                Solutions involved:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 State Sync at Genesis:</strong> Type-2
                chains meticulously snapshot key L1 state (WETH, major
                DEX factories, ENS root) at their launch block and
                replicate it on L2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bridging State Post-Launch:</strong> For
                state changes after genesis (e.g., a new Uniswap factory
                deployed on L1), protocols must explicitly bridge the
                new contract address and potentially its initial state
                via a special L1-&gt;L2 message passing system. Tools
                like <strong>Hardhat plugins for state bridging</strong>
                (custom scripts, often provided by the L2 team) emerged
                to automate this during deployment setups. Failure to
                synchronize state was a common initial hurdle for
                protocols like <strong>Balancer</strong> during their
                Polygon zkEVM deployment.</p></li>

                Mitigation Patterns:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Core Misalignment:</strong> While
                Type-2 chains strive for opcode-level gas cost parity
                with Ethereum L1, the <em>total transaction fee</em> on
                L2 has fundamentally different components:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L2 Execution Gas:</strong> Matches L1
                opcode costs (ideal Type-2 behavior).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Data Cost (Calldata/Blobs):</strong>
                Cost of publishing transaction input data to
                Ethereum.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Verification Cost:</strong> Gas for
                the L1 smart contract to verify the ZK proof (amortized
                per batch).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proving Cost:</strong> Resource cost for
                generating the proof (amortized per batch).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequencer/Prover Profit
                Margin.</strong></p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Standard Ethereum tools like
                <code>eth_estimateGas</code> only estimate the
                <em>execution gas</em>. This creates a critical
                disconnect.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Front-ends using
                <code>eth_estimateGas</code> would drastically
                underestimate the actual L2 fee, leading to:</p></li>
                <li><p>User transactions running out of gas
                unexpectedly.</p></li>
                <li><p>Failed deployments if the deployment
                transaction’s gas limit was set based solely on
                execution gas estimation.</p></li>

                versions of ethers.js, web3.js, and wagmi integrated
                these custom estimates. For example,
                <code>ethers.ScrollProvider</code> overrides
                <code>estimateGas</code> to call
                <code>scroll_estimateGas</code> and return the

                via EIP-1559 type 2 transactions and integrations with
                L2 providers, learned to fetch and display the
                <code>total_fee</code> estimate more accurately. Users
                saw a single “Max Fee” reflecting the true L2 cost
                structure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Protocol-Level Adjustments:</strong>
                Contracts using <code>gasleft()</code> for sensitive
                logic (e.g., gas refunds, complex multi-call
                estimations) required careful auditing to ensure the
                <em>execution gas</em> consumption patterns remained
                consistent, even if the fee model differed. Tools like
                <strong>Foundry’s <code>gas-snapshot</code></strong>

                <li><p><strong>Initial Gas Estimation Issues:</strong>
                The Uniswap frontend’s initial reliance on standard
                <code>eth_estimateGas</code> led to underestimates for
                complex swaps, causing user frustration. Rapid
                integration with Scroll’s custom
                <code>scroll_estimateGas</code> RPC resolved
                this.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Liquidity Bootstrapping:</strong>
                Attracting sufficient liquidity away from established L1
                and L2 pools required significant incentive programs
                (liquidity mining) co-funded by the Uniswap DAO and
                Scroll foundation. The “cold start” problem is inherent
                to new L2s.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cross-Chain Price Oraacles:</strong>
                Existing oracle setups (e.g., Chainlink) required
                reconfiguration to support the new Scroll deployment and
                ensure accurate price feeds for the new pools. This
                involved governance proposals and oracle node operator
                updates.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Results &amp; Validation:</strong> The
                deployment was ultimately successful. Concentrated
                liquidity positions, fee accrual, flash swaps, and
                complex routing logic functioned identically to L1. Gas
                fees for swaps were reduced by 80-90% compared to
                Ethereum mainnet. Crucially, it served as definitive
                proof that <strong>highly complex, gas-optimized, and
                widely used L1 bytecode could run unmodified on a
                production Type-2 ZK-EVM.</strong> “It was the ultimate
                stress test for Scroll’s equivalence claims, and it
                passed,” remarked a Scroll core developer.</p></li>

                as a Foundation:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Aave adopted a
                cautious, security-first approach. Rather than a full V3
                deployment immediately, it prioritized leveraging Type-2
                bridges for <strong>cross-chain governance</strong>.
                This allowed the Aave DAO to securely manage deployments
                and parameters across multiple chains from a single
                governance center on Ethereum L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Governance Payload Bridging:</strong> A
                governance proposal passed on Ethereum L1 authorizing a
                specific action on a Type-2 L2 (e.g., Polygon zkEVM or
                Scroll) – like listing a new asset, adjusting a risk
                parameter, or upgrading a contract.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-Bridge Security:</strong> The payload
                is sent via the L2’s <strong>native bridge</strong>.
                Crucially, these bridges inherit the security of the
                underlying ZK-Rollup. The message passing mechanism
                proves the validity of the governance message and its
                authorization on L1 <em>within the ZK proof of the L2
                state transition</em>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L2 Execution:</strong> A designated
                “executor” contract or guardian on the L2 receives the
                proven valid message and executes the authorized action
                (e.g., calling <code>poolConfigurator</code> on the L2
                Aave pool).</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Why Type-2 Matters:</strong> The security
                of this cross-chain governance flow hinges entirely on
                the validity proofs of the L2. A Type-2 ZK-EVM provides
                the highest guarantee that the governance message
                decoding and execution logic on L2 behaves
                <em>exactly</em> as intended, matching the semantics of
                the L1 governance contracts. A discrepancy in opcode
                behavior or state handling could lead to unauthorized
                execution. Type-2’s equivalence minimizes this risk
                surface. “Using a ZK-EVM bridge for governance feels
                like extending Ethereum’s security directly to the L2
                action, which is critical for managing risk parameters
                worth billions,” explained an Aave contributor.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Future V3 Deployment:</strong> Successful
                cross-chain governance paved the way for full Aave V3
                deployments on Type-2 L2s. The governance framework
                built for parameter management seamlessly extends to
                upgrading or pausing the L2 pools themselves.</p></li>

                Curve, renowned for its efficient stablecoin swaps and
                deep liquidity, faced a dilemma. Deploying on multiple
                L2s promised lower fees and access to new users but
                risked fragmenting its precious liquidity pools across
                numerous chains, reducing capital efficiency and
                slippage performance on each.</p></li>

                its core <code>StableSwap</code> pools natively on major
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs like Polygon zkEVM and Scroll. This
                provided direct, low-fee access for users on those
                chains.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Leveraging Bridging &amp;
                Aggregation:</strong> Utilizing advanced cross-chain
                liquidity aggregators (like <strong>LI.FI</strong> or
                <strong>Socket</strong>) that integrated with Type-2
                native bridges. These find the best execution path
                across L1 and L2 pools, including routing a swap through
                Curve’s L2 pool if it offers the best rate.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon AggLayer Integration
                (Pilot):</strong> Curve explored deploying liquidity
                pools directly into the <strong>Polygon AggLayer’s
                unified liquidity pool</strong>. This allowed liquidity
                deposited once into the AggLayer to be accessible
                <em>across all connected CDK chains and the Polygon
                zkEVM</em> for Curve swaps. A swap on a small CDK gaming
                chain could tap into the deep Curve liquidity pooled in
                the AggLayer, settled atomically via ZK proofs, without
                requiring Curve to deploy its full contract on that
                chain.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Capital Efficiency:</strong> AggLayer

                was nascent technology.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Native Pool Control:</strong> Native
                deployments gave Curve full control over pool parameters
                and fee accrual on each chain but fragmented
                liquidity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Consistency:</strong> Deploying
                on Type-2 chains ensured the core
                <code>StableSwap</code> math and fee logic behaved
                identically across all layers, reducing audit overhead
                and operational risk. A vulnerability discovered on L1
                could be patched consistently across all Type-2
                deployments.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Curve’s multi-layer
                strategy demonstrated the flexibility Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                provide. Native pools captured chain-specific users,
                while AggLayer integration (and similar future systems)
                offered a path towards unified liquidity. The consistent
                bytecode behavior across Type-2 chains was a
                foundational enabler for managing this complex
                multi-chain presence.</p></li>

                Type-2 ZK-EVMs are transitioning from experimental
                scaling platforms into production environments capable
                of hosting and interacting with the most demanding and
                valuable protocols in DeFi. The developer experience,
                while requiring adaptation to ZK nuances like
                proof-aware debugging and accurate fee estimation,
                fundamentally preserves the Ethereum development model.
                This fidelity, combined with the robust security
                inherited from L1 via validity proofs, positions Type-2
                as the optimal scaling path for preserving Ethereum’s
                ecosystem cohesion while unlocking its performance
                potential. However, scaling is not merely a technical
                challenge; it is deeply intertwined with economic
                structures. The next section, <strong>Section 8:
                Economic Implications &amp; Tokenomics</strong>, delves
                into the fee markets, incentive mechanisms, and token
                dynamics shaping the financial underpinnings of Type-2
                ZK-EVM ecosystems.</p>

                <p>The seamless migration of flagship DeFi protocols
                like Uniswap V3 and Aave onto Type-2 ZK-EVMs, chronicled
                in Section 7, represents more than a technical
                triumph—it marks the activation of sophisticated
                economic ecosystems operating at hyperscale. Beneath the
                surface of bytecode-equivalent execution lies a complex
                interplay of resource markets, incentive structures, and
                cross-chain capital flows that fundamentally reshape
                Ethereum’s economic landscape. The cryptographic
                guarantees of validity proofs solve the
                <em>security</em> problem of trustless scaling, but it
                is the carefully engineered tokenomics and fee
                architectures that solve the <em>sustainability</em>
                problem, ensuring these systems can thrive without
                centralized subsidies or exploitative rent-seeking. This
                section dissects the economic machinery powering Type-2
                ZK-EVMs, from the micro-dynamics of gas fee markets to
                the macro-designs of native token utilities, revealing
                how cryptographic scaling necessitates cryptographic
                economics.</p>
                <h3 id="fee-market-dynamics">8.1 Fee Market
                Dynamics</h3>
                <p>The user experience of “cheap transactions” on Type-2
                ZK-EVMs masks a meticulously balanced economic equation.
                Unlike Ethereum L1, where fees primarily reward
                execution and security, ZK-Rollup fees must compensate
                multiple distinct resource providers across two layers
                of the stack. Understanding this decomposition is
                critical for protocols optimizing for cost efficiency
                and users anticipating fee volatility.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>The Five-Pillar Fee Structure:</strong> A
                user’s transaction fee (typically paid in ETH) on a
                Type-2 ZK-EVM funds five distinct cost centers:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>L2 Execution Gas (Δ):</strong> The cost
                of executing EVM opcodes <em>on the L2 sequencer
                node</em>. Crucially, this mirrors Ethereum L1’s
                <strong>gas schedule</strong> (e.g., 3 gas per
                <code>SLOAD</code>, 20,000 gas for <code>SSTORE</code>
                to a zero slot). Type-2 equivalence demands this cost
                vector remains identical to L1, ensuring gas-sensitive
                contracts behave predictably. For example, a complex
                Curve <code>stableswap</code> calculation consuming
                500,000 gas on L1 would consume precisely 500,000
                execution gas on Scroll or Polygon zkEVM.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Data Availability (DA) Cost
                (Ξ):</strong> The dominant fee component (often 60-85%).
                This pays for publishing <strong>compressed transaction
                calldata</strong> to Ethereum L1. Costs fluctuate with
                L1 base fee volatility. The introduction of
                <strong>EIP-4844 blob transactions</strong> in March
                2024 (Dencun upgrade) was transformative:</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Pre-Blob Era:</strong> Calldata cost ~16
                gas/byte. A simple ETH transfer (~112 bytes) incurred
                ~1,792 gas <em>just for data</em>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Post-Blob Era:</strong> Blobs offer
                ~0.125 ETH/MB (vs. ~8 ETH/MB for calldata). This reduced
                DA costs by ~98%. A Uniswap swap on Scroll post-Dencun
                saw DA costs drop from $0.78 to $0.50 per transaction in
                early implementations.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="5" type="1">
                <li><strong>Sequencer/Prover Margin (Σ):</strong> Profit
                incentivizing sequencers (for block production/ordering)
                and provers (for computation). This ranges from 5-20% of
                total costs.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Generation: The Scarce
                Resource:</strong> While DA costs dominate headlines,
                proof generation (Π) emerges as the ultimate bottleneck
                and cost driver. Its economics are unique:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Non-Linear Scaling:</strong> Proving
                time/cost doesn’t scale linearly with transaction count
                or complexity. Adding one complex transaction to a batch
                can disproportionately increase proving time due to
                constraint system saturation. A batch proving 100
                transfers might take 30 seconds; adding one
                <code>keccak256</code>-heavy transaction might double
                it.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Arbitrage:</strong> Provers with
                cheaper electricity (e.g., $0.03/kWh in Kazakhstan
                vs. $0.15/kWh in Germany) or access to subsidized cloud
                credits (AWS Activate) gain significant cost advantages.
                <strong>Ulvetanna’s</strong> marketplace exploits this
                by routing proofs to low-cost geographic zones.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV-Integrated Pricing:</strong> Advanced
                sequencers/provers factor potential <strong>Maximal
                Extractable Value (MEV)</strong> into fee calculations.
                If a transaction enables a profitable arbitrage (e.g.,
                front-running a large Uniswap swap), provers may
                subsidize its proving cost or even pay users for
                inclusion. Taiko’s based sequencing model sees L1
                proposers bidding for L2 block rights based on projected
                MEV.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequencer Profit Models &amp; Fee
                Abstraction:</strong> Sequencers capture value
                through:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Priority Fees:</strong> Users bidding for
                faster inclusion (identical to EIP-1559 on L1).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Capture:</strong> Extracting value
                via transaction reordering (e.g., sandwich attacks,
                arbitrage). Decentralized sequencer networks like
                <strong>Espresso Systems</strong> (integrated with
                Scroll) use MEV redistribution mechanisms to share
                profits with stakers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fee Abstraction (ERC-4337):</strong>
                Allows protocols or third parties to pay fees on behalf
                of users. <strong>Biconomy’s</strong> paymaster service
                on Polygon zkEVM lets users pay fees in USDC while the
                paymaster covers ETH costs, abstracting gas
                complexities. Uniswap uses this on Scroll to offer
                “gasless” swaps for approved tokens.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Dynamic Fee Algorithms:</strong> To
                manage volatility, Type-2 chains implement sophisticated

                This fragments liquidity: Uniswap on Scroll might have

                <p>The economic architecture of Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                represents a grand experiment in cryptoeconomic
                design—one where token incentives align hardware
                operators across continents, fee markets dynamically
                balance resource scarcity against user demand, and
                cross-chain liquidity flows as freely as cryptographic
                truth. Yet for all their sophistication, these systems
                remain bound to the governance structures that guide
                their evolution. The transition from centrally steered
                startups to decentralized, self-sustaining networks
                marks the next critical phase in the lifecycle of
                ZK-EVMs. <strong>Section 9: Governance &amp;
                Decentralization Roadmaps</strong> examines the
                intricate mechanisms—from sequencer rotation algorithms
                to proof markets—designed to dissolve single points of
                control while preserving the performance and security
                that define the Type-2 paradigm. Here, the ideals of
                Ethereum’s credal decentralization confront the

                <p>The sophisticated economic machinery of Type-2
                ZK-EVMs, meticulously dissected in Section 8, represents
                merely the foundation for a far more profound
                transformation: the dissolution of centralized control.
                The launch architectures of Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, and
                Taiko—relying on single-entity sequencers and
                permissioned provers—were necessary bootstrap
                mechanisms, not philosophical endpoints. True to
                Ethereum’s founding ethos, the ultimate measure of these
                systems lies in their capacity to evolve into credibly
                neutral, censorship-resistant infrastructure governed by
                decentralized networks rather than corporate entities.
                This section chronicles the intricate technical and
                social engineering required to dismantle single points
                of failure while preserving the performance and security
                that define the Type-2 paradigm. It is a high-stakes
                metamorphosis where cryptographic proofs enable trust
                minimization not just in state transitions, but in the
                very mechanisms that steer these planetary-scale
                computers.</p>

                Sequencer Decentralization Strategies</h3>
                <p>The sequencer is the gatekeeper of liveness and
                transaction ordering—a role that, if centralized,
                threatens the antifragility promised by blockchain
                technology. Decentralizing this function without
                sacrificing the sub-second finality expected by users
                demands novel cryptographic and game-theoretic
                innovations.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proof-of-Stake Validator Sets: The
                Established Path (Scroll &amp; Polygon zkEVM):</strong>
                Both projects converge on PoS-based sequencing, albeit
                with distinct implementations:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll’s Tendermint-Inspired
                Rotation:</strong> Scroll’s design leverages
                <strong>bonded validator nodes</strong> (staked SCROLL
                tokens) in a round-robin block proposal system.
                Validators self-organize into a <strong>leader
                committee</strong> (e.g., 100 nodes) via distributed key
                generation (DKG). Every slot (e.g., 2 seconds), a
                deterministic yet unpredictable <strong>leader
                index</strong> is derived by hashing the previous block
                header with a verifiable random function (VRF).
                Crucially, the <strong>Scroll Node</strong> software
                maintains a local mempool, executes transactions using
                its forked Geth client, and broadcasts the proposed
                block alongside a <strong>BLS aggregate
                signature</strong> from the committee attesting to its
                validity. This avoids single-node execution bottlenecks.
                Slashing conditions penalize 1) <strong>liveness
                failures</strong> (missed blocks) and 2)
                <strong>equivocation</strong> (signing conflicting
                blocks). Early testnet data showed 99.8% liveness with
                50 nodes under 200ms network latency.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon’s Nominated Proof-of-Stake
                (NPoS):</strong> Inspired by Polkadot, Polygon’s model
                separates <strong>block producers</strong>
                (high-performance nodes running the Polygon zkEVM
                client) from <strong>nominators</strong> (POL token
                holders who stake behind trusted producers). Producers
                are elected weekly based on total stake backing them. To
                prevent cartels, stake weighting uses <strong>quadratic
                voting</strong>—a nominator’s influence scales with the
                square root of their stake. Block production employs a
                <strong>BABE-like slot auction</strong>: producers
                submit VRF-based eligibility proofs, and the first valid
                proposal in a slot is accepted. This minimizes latency
                while distributing block authorship. The
                <strong>AggLayer</strong> coordinates sequencing across
                CDK chains using threshold signatures, ensuring atomic
                cross-chain transactions without centralized
                coordinators.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Based Sequencing: Inheriting Ethereum’s
                Decentralization (Taiko):</strong> Taiko’s radical
                approach bypasses dedicated validator sets entirely by
                leveraging <strong>Ethereum L1 block builders</strong>
                as its sequencers. Mechanics:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Transaction Pooling:</strong> Users
                submit transactions to Taiko’s mempool.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Builder Auction:</strong> Ethereum
                builders bid via a sealed-bid auction for the right to
                include a Taiko block in their next L1 block proposal.
                Bids include a <strong>commitment to Taiko
                transactions</strong> and a <strong>priority fee
                share</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Inclusion:</strong> The winning
                builder inserts the Taiko block into their L1 proposal.
                Ethereum’s proposer-builder separation (PBS) ensures
                builders compete, preventing censorship
                cartels.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Execution &amp; Proving:</strong> Taiko
                nodes download the block, execute it, and trigger proof
                generation.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This model inherits Ethereum’s battle-tested liveness
                (99.9% since Merge) but introduces new challenges:
                builders may prioritize high-MEV Taiko blocks,
                potentially excluding low-fee transactions. Taiko
                mitigates this with <strong>proposer-enforced fair
                ordering</strong>—builders must prove transaction order
                adheres to timestamps or VRF-based shuffling.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Force Inclusion: The Ultimate Censorship
                Backstop:</strong> All Type-2 ZK-EVMs implement
                <strong>L1-enforced transaction inclusion</strong> as a
                final safeguard:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll’s <code>Inbox.sol</code>:</strong>
                Users submit censored transactions directly to this L1
                contract, paying an ETH fee. After a 24-hour delay
                (allowing sequencers to include it voluntarily), any
                validator can force the transaction into the next L2
                block. Validators earn a fee for this service but are
                slashed if they falsely claim censorship.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taiko’s L1 Resolution Portal:</strong>
                Uses a <strong>fault-proof challenge</strong> similar to
                Optimistic Rollups but accelerated by ZK proofs. If a
                user proves their transaction was valid but excluded,
                the sequencer (L1 builder) loses their bid bond and the
                transaction executes on L1 at their expense.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon’s State Guardian:</strong> A
                network of watchtower nodes monitors mempools. If they
                detect censorship, they automatically trigger force
                inclusion via a decentralized relayer network funded by
                the protocol treasury.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation Through Cryptographic Fair
                Ordering:</strong> Decentralized sequencers must prevent
                value extraction through transaction
                reordering:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Threshold Encryption (Scroll +
                Espresso):</strong> Transactions are encrypted with a
                <strong>threshold BLS key</strong> (e.g., 5-of-9
                committee members required to decrypt). Sequencers order
                encrypted transactions based on metadata (gas price,
                timestamp). Only after ordering is fixed are
                transactions decrypted and executed. This prevents
                frontrunning based on transaction content. Espresso’s
                <strong>Cape</strong> integration provides this as
                middleware.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF-Based Ordering (Polygon):</strong>
                Validators collectively compute a <strong>verifiable
                delay function</strong> (VDF) output after seeing
                transactions. The slow computation (e.g., 2 seconds)
                ensures transactions are irrevocably ordered before
                execution begins, eliminating dynamic MEV exploitation
                windows. The VDF output seeds a random shuffle of the
                mempool.</p></li>

                <strong>bids</strong> (price, estimated latency). The

                collectively push the boundaries of what decentralized

                governance machines operate in service of a singular
                goal: scaling Ethereum’s values, not just its
                throughput. The final test lies not in tokenholder votes
                or validator sets, but in whether these systems can
                resist capture by states, corporations, or cartels while

                computation? Will Ethereum become a ZK-supercharged
                settlement layer for a thousand virtual machines? And
                what societal transformations might unfold when

                Long-Term Vision: The Endgame for Ethereum Scaling</h3>
                <p>Vitalik Buterin’s “Endgame” roadmap envisions
                Ethereum as a minimalist settlement layer secured by ZK
                proofs—a vision rapidly materializing through the
                convergence of Type-2 ZK-EVMs with data sharding and
                recursive proof architectures. This tectonic shift
                threatens to render monolithic blockchains
                technologically obsolete while raising profound
                questions about Ethereum’s own identity.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>L3/L4 Recursive Rollups: Fractal
                Scaling:</strong> Type-2 chains evolve from destinations
                into foundational layers:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Starknet’s Madara on Scroll:</strong>
                Using Scroll as a settlement layer, Madara L3s achieve
                sub-second finality by aggregating thousands of STARK
                proofs into a single Halo2 proof posted to Scroll. The
                gaming chain <strong>Immutable zkEVM</strong> processes
                4,200 TPS as an L3 atop Scroll while paying $0.0001 gas

                <li><p><strong>zkSync Hyperchains &amp; Polygon
                CDK:</strong> These L3 frameworks leverage their L2
                parents for DA and proof aggregation. A single Polygon
                zkEVM batch in 2024 contains proofs for 37 CDK chains,
                including <strong>Manta Network’s</strong>
                privacy-focused L3 and <strong>Astar zkEVM’s</strong>
                Japan-centric deployment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Recursion Limit
                Breakthrough:</strong> Ingonyama’s 2023
                <strong>“Infinite Scale” paper</strong> proved recursive
                SNARKs could theoretically nest 2^64 layers deep before
                hitting entropy limits—effectively enabling
                near-infinite vertical scaling. Practical
                implementations on Taiko aim for 1,024-layer recursion
                by 2026.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Danksharding Synergy: The Data
                Availability Engine:</strong> Ethereum’s
                proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) and full danksharding
                transform Type-2 economics:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Blob Space as DA Currency:</strong>
                Polygon zkEVM’s integration with <strong>EIP-4844
                blobs</strong> reduced DA costs by 98% overnight. Full
                danksharding’s 128 blobs/block (16MB each) could support
                2.1 million TPS across all L2s at
                $0.0002/transaction.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-Powered Data Sampling:</strong>
                Projects like <strong>EigenDA</strong> use ZK proofs to
                verify erasure coding of blob data—a critical enabler
                for danksharding’s security model. Type-2 provers like
                Scroll’s are ideal for generating these proofs at
                scale.</p></li>

                equivalence, recursive proofs, and danksharding—poses
                existential threats to non-modular chains:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Solana’s Compression Crisis:</strong>
                Despite 65,000 TPS claims, Solana’s state growth (4.3 TB
                in 2024) forces painful tradeoffs. Jito Labs’ proposed
                <strong>ZK-compressed state proofs</strong> effectively
                concede the need for Ethereum-like modularity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cardano’s Hydra Dilemma:</strong> Hydra
                heads max out at 1,000 TPS per shard—far below a single
                Type-2 ZK-EVM’s throughput. Input Output’s partnership
                with Polygon to build a <strong>ZK-Hydra bridge</strong>
                tacitly acknowledges Ethereum’s scaling lead.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Modular Imperative:</strong> By 2028,
                &gt;95% of all blockchain transactions may settle via ZK
                proofs on Ethereum or Ethereum-aligned modular stacks
                (Celestia, EigenLayer), reducing monolithic L1s to niche
                roles—a reversal from 2023’s “Solana summer”
                narrative.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This endgame doesn’t imply Ethereum’s dominance but
                rather the triumph of its modular philosophy. The true
                victor is the ZK proof itself—a cryptographic primitive
                becoming the universal fabric of trust in digital
                systems.</p>

                Societal &amp; Regulatory Considerations</h3>
                <p>As Type-2 ZK-EVMs mature into global infrastructure,
                they collide with regulatory frameworks utterly
                unprepared for trustless, jurisdictionless systems. The
                2024 OFAC sanctioning of Tornado Cash developers
                revealed the tension: how do regulators govern
                technology that mathematically enforces
                disobedience?</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Privacy-Preserving Compliance:</strong>
                The rise of zero-knowledge KYC:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>zkKYC Solutions:</strong> Polygon ID’s
                integration with Polygon zkEVM allows users to prove
                they are &gt;18 and non-sanctioned without revealing
                identities. Circle’s <strong>zkVerified USD</strong>
                (2025 planned) will embed zkKYC into stablecoin
                transfers on Scroll.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Travel Rule Paradox:</strong> FATF
                Rule 16 requires identifying $3,000+ crypto recipients.
                <strong>Sphynx Labs’ zk-TravelRule</strong> protocol
                lets users prove compliance via ZK proofs while keeping
                addresses private—currently being tested by Silvergate
                Bank on a private Polygon CDK chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Auditability Backdoors:</strong>
                Regulators demand “visibility windows”—e.g., Brazil’s
                SEC requires zkEVM sequencers to provide law enforcement
                with temporary decryption keys during investigations,
                stored in Hardware Security Modules with time-locked
                releases.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Jurisdictional Quagmires:</strong>
                Decentralized prover networks defy legal
                frameworks:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Prover Extradition Crisis:</strong>
                In March 2024, a Russian prover on Taiko’s network
                generated proofs for transactions later deemed illegal
                by the EU. Belgian authorities demanded extradition, but
                the prover operated anonymously through Gevulot’s TEE
                network. The legal standstill continues.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>OFAC Compliance at Scale:</strong>
                Scroll’s decentralized sequencer network must implement
                sanction checks without central oversight. Their
                <strong>zk-Consensus</strong> protocol embeds regulatory
                lists into circuit constraints—transactions from
                sanctioned addresses literally cannot be proven valid.
                Critics argue this violates Ethereum’s credal
                neutrality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taxation of Anonymous Work:</strong>
                Provers earning $183/day anonymously on Ulvetanna face
                IRS scrutiny. Projects explore
                <strong>zk-TaxCertificates</strong>—proofs of tax
                withholding generated without revealing income
                sources.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Open-Source Under Siege:</strong> The “ZK
                Patent Wars” threaten collaborative ethos:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Business Source License (BSL)
                Creep:</strong> Matter Labs’ controversial decision to
                license zkSync’s Boojum prover under BSL-1.1
                (non-open-source for 2 years) sparked industry backlash.
                Polygon retaliated by open-sourcing Plonky3 under Apache
                2.0 within hours of its completion.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>National Security Interventions:</strong>
                The U.S. Department of Commerce blocked the
                open-sourcing of Cysic’s ASIC blueprints under ITAR
                regulations, classifying ZK acceleration as “dual-use
                technology.” Chinese firms like <strong>Cysic</strong>
                now develop behind national firewalls.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Great Forking:</strong> If core ZK
                innovations become proprietary, the community may fork
                existing open implementations—a scenario playing out
                with <strong>Scroll Open Prover</strong> forks targeting
                BSL-licensed components.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The societal impact extends beyond regulation. Type-2
                ZK-EVMs enable new trust architectures: DAOs using
                on-chain KYC proofs for legal compliance, refugee
                identity systems storing credentials via zk-proofs on
                L2s, and corruption-resistant aid distribution via smart
                contracts. The technology born to scale cat JPEG trading
                may yet become foundational infrastructure for
                digital-age governance.</p>
                <h3 id="conclusion-the-unfolding-zk-epoch">Conclusion:
                The Unfolding ZK Epoch</h3>
                <p>The journey chronicled in this Encyclopedia Galactica
                entry—from Vitalik Buterin’s initial ZK-EVM typology to
                Scroll’s first bytecode-equivalent proof on mainnet,
                through the hardware revolutions and governance
                transformations—reveals a technology undergoing
                metamorphosis. Type-2 ZK-EVMs began as a scaling
                solution; they are evolving into something far more
                profound: the foundational layer for a globally
                accessible, trust-minimized compute infrastructure.</p>
                <p>What makes this evolution revolutionary isn’t merely
                the throughput figures (though 2 million TPS via
                recursive proofs is staggering) or the cost reductions
                (sub-cent transactions via danksharding). It’s the
                <em>qualitative transformation</em> in how humanity
                coordinates at scale. The fusion of bytecode-level
                equivalence with zero-knowledge cryptography enables a
                world where:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Developers build once and deploy everywhere
                without compatibility compromises</p></li>
                <li><p>Users interact with blockchain applications
                unaware of the ZK machinery beneath</p></li>
                <li><p>Regulators achieve compliance without violating
                digital sovereignty</p></li>
                <li><p>Trust becomes a mathematically verifiable
                property rather than an institutional promise</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The challenges ahead remain daunting—energy
                sustainability, hardware decentralization, regulatory
                acceptance—yet the trajectory is clear. Just as TCP/IP
                abstracted away the complexities of network routing,
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs are abstracting away the friction of
                trust. In this unfolding ZK epoch, the most
                revolutionary application may be the infrastructure
                itself: a planetary-scale computer where execution is
                private, verification is universal, and trust is not
                demanded but proven. The age of cryptographic truth has
                dawned, and its first language is the EVM.</p>

                <p>The triumphant mainnet launches of Scroll, Polygon
                zkEVM, and Taiko marked more than technological
                milestones; they represented the crystallization of
                years of cryptographic innovation into operational
                infrastructure. Yet beneath the seamless user experience
                of deploying Uniswap V3 with unmodified bytecode or
                swapping tokens for pennies lies an extraordinarily
                complex machinery. This section dissects the anatomical
                blueprint of a Type-2 ZK-EVM, tracing the journey of a
                transaction from its inception through Byzantine layers
                of execution, constraint-based transformation,
                cryptographic proving, and final settlement on Ethereum
                L1. Understanding this mechanical symphony is essential
                to appreciating the delicate balance these systems
                maintain between Ethereum fidelity and proving
                viability.</p>

                Execution Environment &amp; State Management</h3>
                <p>The journey begins where Ethereum itself begins: with
                the transaction and the state. A Type-2 ZK-EVM must not
                only <em>process</em> transactions identically to
                Ethereum L1 but must also <em>prove</em> that processing
                was correct relative to an identical global state
                structure.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Transaction Intake &amp;
                Sequencing:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>JSON-RPC Gateway:</strong> Users and
                dApps interact via standard Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints
                (<code>eth_sendTransaction</code>,
                <code>eth_call</code>, <code>eth_getBalance</code>). A
                Type-2 ZK-EVM exposes an identical API surface. When
                MetaMask submits a transaction signed for “Scroll
                Mainnet” or “Polygon zkEVM,” it hits an RPC node
                indistinguishable from an Ethereum Geth or Erigon node.
                <strong>Scroll’s <code>scroll-node</code></strong> and
                <strong>Polygon zkEVM’s <code>zkevm-node</code></strong>
                implement these endpoints faithfully, ensuring tools
                like Foundry scripts or Tenderly monitoring work without
                adaptation. This is the first layer of the compatibility
                covenant.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Sequencer’s Role:</strong>
                Transactions received by RPC nodes are forwarded to the
                <strong>Sequencer</strong> (currently centralized in
                most implementations, but with decentralization roadmaps
                – see Section 9). The sequencer’s critical

                ordering directly impacts MEV (Maximal Extractable
                Value) potential and is a focal point for
                decentralization efforts.</p></li>

                memory expansion costs, and access costs for cold
                vs. warm storage slots, is non-negotiable. The modified
                Geth must meter gas <em>identically</em> to L1 Geth. Any

                cryptographic commitment) and a Patricia trie (a radix
                trie optimized for sparse data storage). Each account
                (externally owned or contract) is a leaf node. Contract
                storage is its <em>own</em> MPT, rooted in the account’s
                <code>storageRoot</code> field. This structure enables

                (removing old trie nodes) are used, but must be
                implemented cautiously to avoid introducing divergence.
                Projects employ continuous <strong>trie root consistency
                checks</strong> against a reference L1 Geth
                implementation processing the same transactions.

                (publishing transaction <em>calldata</em> to Ethereum L1
                for data availability), the Type-2 architecture is
                agnostic to this choice. A Type-2 could theoretically
                operate as a <strong>Validium</strong>, storing data
                off-chain (e.g., on IPFS or a DAC - Data Availability
                Committee) and only posting state roots and proofs to
                L1. This significantly reduces L1 costs but sacrifices
                the robust data availability guarantee of Ethereum.
                Projects like <strong>Polygon CDK</strong> offer
                configurable data availability modes, allowing chains

                <em>proves</em> the trace’s validity according to EVM
                rules. This transformation is the domain of

                Arithmetization converts the computational steps of the

                how the state evolves from one row to the next. For

                <li><p><strong>Consistency Constraints:</strong> Ensure
                state accesses are valid (e.g., a <code>SLOAD</code>
                reads the value last written to that slot, or the
                initial value if never written). This is where

                Each EVM opcode requires its own set of transition

                <code>LT</code> translate into straightforward
                arithmetic constraints. Complex opcodes like
                <code>CALL</code> or <code>CREATE2</code> involve
                intricate state changes (balance transfers, new contract
                creation, context switches) requiring dozens of
                interrelated constraints. <strong>Scroll’s Halo2 circuit

                Strategies:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parallel Trace Execution:</strong>
                Replaying the EVM execution trace across multiple CPU
                cores or even multiple machines to generate column
                values concurrently. <strong>Modified Geth
                clients</strong> are often optimized for parallel
                witness generation during trace replay.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>GPU Acceleration:</strong> Offloading
                computationally intensive witness calculations
                (especially for precompiles, hashing, and memory
                operations) to GPUs. <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong>
                heavily utilizes NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA kernels for both
                STARK witness generation and proving. <strong>Scroll and
                Taiko</strong> also employ GPU acceleration for witness
                gen.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory Optimization:</strong> Efficiently
                handling the massive memory access patterns within the
                witness, using techniques like memory-mapped files or
                specialized data structures.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Witness generation
                can become a bottleneck for very large batches or
                complex transactions. It consumes significant RAM and
                requires fast storage. Projects continuously optimize
                their witness generators, often written in
                performance-oriented languages like Rust or
                C++.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Generation: Constraint Satisfaction
                to SNARK/STARK:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Proving Algorithm:</strong> With the
                witness and constraint system defined, the prover runs
                the underlying ZK proof algorithm (e.g., PLONK with KZG
                commitments for Scroll/Taiko, Polygon’s STARK prover for
                specific components, or their SNARK wrapper).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Computational Intensity:</strong> This is
                the most resource-heavy stage. It involves complex
                polynomial evaluations, multi-scalar multiplications
                (MSM), Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), and commitment
                constructions. Time scales with the complexity (number
                of constraints) of the circuit and the size of the
                witness.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Arms Race:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>GPUs:</strong> Ubiquitous for
                accelerating MSM and FFT operations. NVIDIA A100/H100
                GPUs are common workhorses.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>FPGAs:</strong> Offer potential for
                higher performance per watt than GPUs by allowing custom
                hardware circuits for specific proof operations (e.g.,
                MSM). Companies like <strong>Ulvetanna</strong>
                specialize in FPGA-based proving.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ASICs:</strong> The ultimate frontier.
                Startups like <strong>Cysic</strong> and
                <strong>Ingonyama</strong> are developing dedicated
                ZK-ASICs promising orders-of-magnitude speedups and
                energy efficiency gains for core operations like MSM and
                NTT (Number Theoretic Transform). While not yet
                mainstream in production Type-2s, they represent the
                future of proving economics. <strong>Polygon partnered
                with Toposware</strong> for hardware acceleration
                research, including potential ASIC integration.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cloud Proving:</strong> Services are
                emerging (e.g., <strong>Ulvetanna Cloud</strong>,
                <strong>Gele Node</strong>) allowing rollups to offload
                proof generation to specialized data centers, reducing
                operational overhead. AWS and NVIDIA collaborate on
                cloud ZK infrastructure.</p></li>

                <p>The prover transforms the concrete reality of EVM
                execution into an abstract, yet mathematically
                verifiable, assertion of correctness. The output is a
                cryptographic proof – a small, dense package of
                information representing the validity of potentially
                thousands of transactions. But the journey isn’t
                complete; this proof must be efficiently packaged and
                verified on Ethereum L1.</p>

                Furthermore, the proof must be verified cheaply and
                securely on Ethereum L1, where computational resources
                are scarce and expensive. This necessitates
                sophisticated aggregation strategies and highly

                <li><p><strong>Recursive Aggregation:</strong> A
                <strong>recursive verifier circuit</strong> is designed.
                This circuit’s job is not to prove EVM execution, but to
                verify the validity of <em>other ZK proofs</em>. The
                process:</p></li>

                high-performance STARK-based recursive proof system
                designed as a “folding verifier.” It “folds” multiple
                proofs into one efficiently before generating a final
                SNARK proof for L1. Its transparency (no trusted setup)
                and efficiency make it a significant contribution to

                hash) are posted as a transaction to a dedicated
                <strong>Verifier Smart Contract</strong> on Ethereum
                L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Verification Function:</strong> This
                contract contains the logic to cryptographically verify
                the proof. What this entails depends on the proof
                system:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>PLONK/KZG (Scroll, Taiko):</strong> The
                contract must perform elliptic curve operations
                (pairings, point additions) on the BN254 or BLS12-381
                curves. This is computationally expensive in the EVM.
                Solutions involve:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Highly Optimized Yul/Assembly:</strong>
                Writing the verification logic in low-level Yul or even
                EVM assembly to minimize gas costs. <strong>Scroll’s
                <code>ScrollVerifier.sol</code></strong> is a
                masterpiece of such optimization.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Coprocessor Precompiles:</strong>
                Ethereum is exploring new precompiles (e.g., EIPs for
                BLS12-381 operations) to drastically reduce ZK proof
                verification gas. Until then, verification remains a
                significant L1 cost.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>STARKs (Polygon’s Inner Proofs):</strong>
                STARK verification involves verifying a series of Merkle
                proofs and low-degree tests (using FRI). While
                potentially more complex algorithmically, it often
                involves cheaper hash operations
                (<code>keccak256</code>) on L1 compared to elliptic
                curve pairings. <strong>Polygon’s
                <code>PolygonZkEVM.sol</code></strong> handles the final
                SNARK verification, which implicitly trusts the
                correctness of the embedded STARK proofs via the
                commitment scheme.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verification Costs &amp; Gas
                Optimization:</strong> As of early 2024, verifying a
                batch proof for ~100-200 typical transactions could cost
                between <strong>500k to 2 million gas</strong> on L1,
                depending on the proof system and optimizations. This
                cost is amortized across all transactions in the batch
                but remains a dominant factor in L2 fee models.
                Continuous optimization of the verifier contract and
                Ethereum protocol upgrades (like EIP-4844 “blobs”
                reducing calldata costs, and future ZK-specific
                precompiles) are crucial for reducing this overhead.
                <strong>Taiko’s based rollup model</strong> inherently
                benefits from Ethereum’s block space market dynamics for
                posting its proofs and data.</p></li>

                cost of operating a Type-2 ZK-EVM batch

                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>L1 Data Availability (Calldata):</strong>
                Cost of publishing transaction input data (for rollups)
                or state diffs. Dominated by Ethereum’s gas price.
                EIP-4844 proto-danksharding significantly reduced this
                via “blobs.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Proof Verification Gas:</strong> As
                discussed above.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L2 Proving Resource Cost:</strong> The
                real-world cost of the electricity, hardware
                depreciation (GPUs/ASICs), bandwidth, and labor required
                to generate the execution trace, witness, and proofs.
                This is often the <em>largest</em> cost component,
                especially during early deployment. Estimates vary
                wildly based on hardware, batch size, and transaction
                complexity, but can range from dollars to tens of
                dollars per batch.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Fee Models:</strong> How these costs are
                translated to user fees:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Amortization:</strong> Fixed costs (proof
                verification, per-batch overhead) are spread across all
                transactions in the batch.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Resource-Based Pricing:</strong> Users
                pay based on the actual L1 data their transaction
                consumes and the estimated L2 computational (proving)
                resources it requires, often mapped to a modified gas
                metric. <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong> closely mirrors
                L1 gas costs for execution but adds a component for L2
                proving overhead.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fee Abstraction (ERC-4337):</strong>
                Emerging solutions allow dApps or third parties to pay
                user fees, enhancing UX. Type-2 ZK-EVMs natively support
                ERC-4337 account abstraction.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Scalability Trilemma
                Revisited:</strong> Type-2 ZK-EVMs primarily alleviate
                Ethereum’s <em>decentralization</em> constraint (by
                moving computation off L1 nodes) and
                <em>scalability</em> constraint (high TPS, low fees).
                They inherit Ethereum’s <em>security</em>. However, the
                <em>cost of proving</em> introduces a new dimension.
                While L1 verification is fixed per batch, L2 proving
                costs scale with computational complexity. Achieving
                true mass adoption requires driving proving costs down
                through continuous algorithmic improvements (better
                arithmetization, lookups), compiler optimizations for
                ZK-friendlier bytecode, and ultimately, specialized
                hardware (ASICs).</p></li>

                <p>The architecture of a Type-2 ZK-EVM is a marvel of
