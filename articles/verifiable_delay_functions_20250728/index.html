                1: Defining the Temporal Enigma: What are Verifiable
                Delay Functions?</h2>
                <p>In the intricate tapestry of cryptography, where
                secrets are guarded by mathematical fortresses and
                digital trust is woven from complex algorithms, the
                concept of <em>time</em> has long been an elusive
                specter. How can a decentralized network, devoid of a
                trusted timekeeper, impose a meaningful, verifiable
                delay? How can it guarantee that a specific
                computational result <em>required</em> a minimum passage
                of time, measured in computational effort, to produce,
                yet can be checked for correctness almost instantly? The
                answer to this profound challenge lies in a remarkable
                cryptographic primitive: the <strong>Verifiable Delay
                Function (VDF)</strong>.</p>
                <p>Imagine needing to create a publicly verifiable proof
                that you spent exactly ten minutes solving a complex
                puzzle, even though anyone else can confirm your
                solution is correct in mere milliseconds. Or picture a
                decentralized lottery where the winning number
                <em>must</em> be the result of a computation that took a
                fixed, significant amount of time to complete, ensuring
                no participant could have secretly calculated multiple
                possibilities to cheat. These scenarios capture the
                essence of VDFs. They are functions specifically
                designed to take a significant, predetermined amount of
                <em>sequential</em> computational time to evaluate (the
                “Delay”), yet whose output can be verified as correct
                extremely quickly (the “Verifiable”). Crucially, this
                delay is inherent to the computation itself; it cannot
                be significantly shortened by throwing more parallel
                processors at the problem. This unique combination –
                <strong>inherent sequentiality</strong> paired with
                <strong>instantaneous verifiability</strong> – elevates
                VDFs beyond simple hashing or brute-force puzzles like
                Proof of Work (PoW), establishing them as a distinct and
                powerful tool for building decentralized systems that
                require unbiased timing, unpredictable randomness, and
                resistance to manipulation.</p>
                <p>Formally, a Verifiable Delay Function is defined by
                three algorithms:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong><code>Setup(λ, T) → pp</code>:</strong>
                Given a security parameter <code>λ</code> (governing the
                overall cryptographic strength) and a delay parameter
                <code>T</code> (dictating the target number of
                sequential steps), this algorithm generates public
                parameters <code>pp</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><code>Eval(pp, x) → (y, π)</code>:</strong>
                Taking the public parameters <code>pp</code> and an
                input <code>x</code> (often called the “challenge”),
                this function performs a sequential computation
                requiring <em>at least</em> <code>T</code> sequential
                steps. It outputs the result <code>y</code> and an
                optional, typically very short, <em>proof</em>
                <code>π</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><code>Verify(pp, x, y, π) → {Accept, Reject}</code>:</strong>
                Using the public parameters <code>pp</code>, the input
                <code>x</code>, the claimed output <code>y</code>, and
                the proof <code>π</code>, this algorithm
                <em>quickly</em> verifies (in time significantly less
                than <code>T</code>, ideally logarithmic or constant in
                <code>T</code>) whether <code>y</code> is indeed the
                correct output of <code>Eval(pp, x)</code>.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Sequentiality:</strong> This is the core of
                the “Delay.” It guarantees that no adversary, even one
                with access to vast amounts of parallel computational
                resources (e.g., millions of CPUs, specialized ASICs),
                can compute the function <code>Eval(pp, x)</code>
                significantly faster than by performing the computation
                sequentially step-by-step. More precisely, for any
                probabilistic polynomial-time adversary <code>A</code>
                running on a polynomial number of parallel processors,
                the probability that <code>A</code> computes
                <code>y</code> such that
                <code>Verify(pp, x, y, π) = Accept</code> in time
                substantially less than <code>T</code> sequential steps
                is negligible. This property ensures the <em>minimum

                mountain via a single, narrow path. You <em>must</em>
                take each step in sequence; having a million friends
                doesn’t help you climb faster because they can’t climb
                the path simultaneously. The mountain path represents
                the inherently sequential computation enforced by the
                VDF. In contrast, Proof of Work (PoW) is like searching
                a vast field for a specific rare flower. Throwing more
                people (parallel processors) onto the field
                <em>dramatically</em> speeds up the search. VDFs resist
                this parallelization.</li>

                can produce a different pair <code>(y', π')</code> such
                that <code>y' ≠ y</code> and
                <code>Verify(pp, x, y', π') = Accept</code>. Soundness

                guarantee that <code>y</code> is the one and only valid

                about the result of the long computation. This is
                distinct from PoW, where multiple valid solutions
                (nonces) might exist for a given block, or where an
                adversary could potentially present an incorrect block
                with a valid PoW if the verification criteria were
                flawed (though the protocol usually prevents this). VDF
                soundness provides mathematical certainty about

                is no ambiguity. There is only one “correct answer” at
                the end of the sequential computation. This is vital for
                applications like randomness beacons or leader election,
                where multiple possible “valid” outputs could allow an
                adversary to choose the one most beneficial to them (a
                “grinding” attack). Compare this to PoW, where many
                different nonces can produce a hash below the target, or
                to simple hash chains where the next value is uniquely
                determined but lacks the verifiable delay property.</li>

                <p><strong>Why all three are essential and
                non-redundant:</strong> Imagine a primitive with
                Sequentiality and Soundness but lacking Uniqueness. An
                adversary could potentially compute multiple valid
                outputs <code>y1, y2, ...</code> for the same
                <code>x</code>. While each <code>yi</code> would require
                sequential work to compute, and each would be sound
                (verifiable as correct for that specific
                <code>yi</code>), the adversary could choose which
                <code>yi</code> to reveal <em>after</em> seeing external
                events, manipulating the outcome (e.g., choosing the
                lottery winner after seeing bets). Uniqueness prevents
                this. Conversely, Sequentiality without
                Soundness/Uniqueness is meaningless – anyone could claim
                any result instantly. Soundness/Uniqueness without
                Sequentiality describes a standard verifiable
                computation, but fails to provide the crucial time delay
                guarantee. Only the triad provides the complete package:
                a result that <em>took a guaranteed minimum time</em> to
                compute, is <em>mathematically verifiable as
                correct</em>, and is <em>the only possible correct
                result</em> for that input.</p>
                <p><strong>Distinction from Related
                Concepts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> PoW
                achieves a <em>probabilistic</em> notion of elapsed time
                through massive parallel computation. It lacks inherent
                sequentiality (ASICs parallelize it efficiently), lacks
                uniqueness (many valid nonces), and verification, while
                fast, is tied to the inherently wasteful parallel
                search. VDFs provide <em>deterministic, inherent</em>
                sequential delay, uniqueness, and fast verification
                based on proofs, not brute force.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hash Chains:</strong> A sequence like
                <code>h(h(h(...h(x)...)))</code> (T times) is sequential
                but lacks efficient verifiability. Verifying the T-th
                hash requires recalculating all T steps, making
                verification as slow as computation. VDFs break this
                symmetry with succinct proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Timed Commitments:</strong> These involve
                committing to a secret that can only be opened after a
                forced time delay (often using time-lock puzzles). While
                sharing the time-binding goal, they focus on secrecy and
                eventual revelation, not necessarily on producing a
                unique, publicly verifiable output <em>of the
                computation itself</em> with a fast verification
                mechanism. VDFs are a more general and versatile
                primitive for proving the passage of sequential
                computation time on public inputs.</p></li>

                The Core Challenge: Unbending Sequentiality</h3>
                <p>The defining feat of a VDF is not merely that it
                takes a long time, but that this time <em>cannot be
                compressed</em> through parallelism. This “unbending
                sequentiality” is the hardest property to achieve
                cryptographically. Why is parallel processing
                powerless?</p>
                <p>The answer lies in the fundamental structure of the
                computation enforced by the VDF. It must be designed
                such that each computational step <em>critically
                depends</em> on the result of the immediately preceding
                step. There is no way to compute step <code>N+1</code>
                without first having the result of step <code>N</code>.
                This creates a linear dependency chain. Adding more
                processors doesn’t help because processor <code>K</code>
                cannot start its assigned chunk of work until processor
                <code>K-1</code> has finished <em>and provided a result
                that processor <code>K</code> absolutely needs</em>. In
                practice, this often manifests as iterative operations
                where the output of one iteration is the mandatory input
                for the next.</p>
                <p><strong>The Role of Inherent Sequential Computation
                vs. Parallelism:</strong> Standard computations can
                often be broken down into independent sub-tasks (e.g.,
                rendering different parts of a frame, checking different
                password guesses). Parallel processors excel at these.
                Inherently sequential computations have a strict,
                unbreakable order. VDFs are carefully constructed to
                embed such sequentiality. A canonical example is
                <strong>repeated squaring in a group of unknown
                order</strong>: computing <code>y = x^(2^T) mod N</code>
                where <code>N</code> is an RSA modulus (product of two
                large primes). Calculating this requires performing
                <code>T</code> sequential squarings:
                <code>x_1 = x^2 mod N</code>,
                <code>x_2 = x_1^2 mod N</code>, …,
                <code>x_T = x_{T-1}^2 mod N</code>. You cannot compute
                <code>x_{T/2}</code> without first computing
                <code>x_{T/2 - 1}</code>, and so on. While modular
                squaring itself is parallelizable <em>within one
                step</em>, the <em>sequence</em> of <code>T</code> steps
                is inherently sequential. No amount of parallel
                processors can reduce the wall-clock time below the time
                taken to perform <code>T</code> sequential squarings on
                a single processor (modulo small constant factors from
                optimized hardware).</p>
                <p><strong>Depth-Robustness: The Graph-Theoretic
                Foundation:</strong> The theoretical underpinning of
                sequentiality often traces back to the concept of
                <strong>depth-robust graphs</strong>. Imagine a directed
                acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent computational
                steps and edges represent dependencies (step B requires
                the output of step A). The “depth” of the graph is the
                length of the longest path from an input node to an
                output node.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Depth-Robustness:</strong> A graph is
                depth-robust if, even after removing a large number of
                nodes (up to some fraction), the remaining subgraph
                still has high depth. In simpler terms, there’s no small
                set of “bottleneck” nodes whose removal drastically
                shortens the longest dependency chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Connection to VDFs:</strong> VDF
                constructions can be designed by embedding computations
                within depth-robust graphs. Evaluating the function
                requires computing the output node, which depends on a
                long path through the graph. An adversary trying to
                compute the output faster with parallelism might
                precompute some subgraphs. However, the depth-robustness
                property guarantees that no matter which nodes the
                adversary precomputes (removes from the critical path),
                a long sequential path <em>still</em> remains that must
                be computed at evaluation time. Well-known examples of
                depth-robust graphs used in theoretical constructions
                include <strong>stacked superconcentrators</strong>.
                While practical VDFs like repeated squaring often
                directly enforce sequentiality without explicitly
                building complex graphs, the concept of depth-robustness
                provides a crucial theoretical framework for
                understanding and proving the sequentiality
                guarantees.</p></li>

                The Verification Mirage: Fast and Easy Checking</h3>
                <p>The sequentiality property dictates that computing
                <code>Eval(pp, x)</code> <em>must</em> be slow. Yet, the
                <code>Verify</code> algorithm is astonishingly fast.
                This seems almost paradoxical. How can verifying the
                correctness of a long, complex computation be
                exponentially faster than performing it? This is the
                “Verification Mirage” – the result of clever
                cryptographic proof systems.</p>
                <p><strong>How Verification Bypasses Sequential
                Work:</strong> The key lies in the <strong>succinct
                proof (witness) <code>π</code></strong> generated during
                <code>Eval</code>. This proof is not the entire
                computation trace (which would be huge and take as long
                to verify as to compute), but rather a small piece of
                cryptographic evidence. This evidence is constructed
                using sophisticated mathematical techniques that allow
                the verifier to check a complex relationship between the
                input <code>x</code> and output <code>y</code> without
                redoing the work. The prover (evaluator) essentially
                does extra work during the slow sequential computation
                to generate this short proof, enabling anyone to verify
                the result quickly.</p>
                <p><strong>The Role of Succinct Proofs:</strong> The
                most common technique used in practical VDFs (like
                Pietrzak’s and Wesolowski’s) is based on <strong>Proofs
                of Exponentiation (PoE)</strong>. Recall the repeated
                squaring example <code>y = x^(2^T) mod N</code>. A PoE
                allows the prover to convince the verifier that
                <code>y</code> is indeed <code>x</code> raised to
                <code>2^T</code> (mod <code>N</code>), without the
                verifier performing <code>T</code> squarings. This is
                achieved through an interactive protocol made
                non-interactive via the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, or
                directly through clever algebraic relationships.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Wesolowski’s Simple Proof:</strong> A
                particularly elegant scheme involves the prover
                computing not just <code>y = x^(2^T)</code>, but also
                storing a checkpoint <code>mu = x^(2^(T/2))</code> (or
                at a specific point chosen via Fiat-Shamir). The proof
                <code>π</code> involves computing a root related to
                <code>mu</code> and <code>y</code>. The verifier
                performs a few modular exponentiations (often just one
                or two) involving <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and
                <code>π</code>, whose exponents are <em>much
                smaller</em> than <code>2^T</code>, making verification
                constant time or logarithmic in <code>T</code>. The
                security relies on the computational hardness of taking
                roots or finding low-order elements in the underlying
                group (like the RSA group).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Efficiency Requirements for
                Verifiers:</strong> For VDFs to be practical in
                decentralized settings, especially blockchains with many
                nodes, verification <em>must</em> be extremely
                efficient. Ideally, verification time should be
                <em>independent</em> of the delay parameter
                <code>T</code> (constant time) or grow very slowly
                (logarithmic in <code>T</code>). Succinct proof systems
                like PoE achieve this. The proof size itself must also
                be small (succinct) – typically constant size (e.g., one
                or two group elements) – to minimize communication
                overhead. This combination of fast verification and
                small proof size is what makes VDFs deployable at scale,
                transforming a slow computation into a quickly
                verifiable assertion of elapsed sequential time.</p>

                <p>The term “Verifiable Delay Function” is remarkably
                descriptive, capturing its two core innovations. But its
                journey to formalization was an evolution spanning
                decades, driven by persistent cryptographic
                challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Tracing the Terminology: From Time-Lock
                Puzzles to VDFs:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Spark (1996):</strong> The seminal
                work came from Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and David Wagner.
                In their paper “<strong><a
                href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RSW96.pdf">Time-Lock
                Puzzles and Timed-Release Crypto</a></strong>,” they
                introduced the concept of a “Time-Lock Puzzle.” Their
                goal: encrypt a message so that it cannot be decrypted
                until a specified amount of sequential computational
                time has passed, even for an adversary with vast
                parallel resources. Their elegant solution used repeated
                squaring modulo an RSA number
                (<code>y = 2^(2^T) mod N</code>). Crucially, they
                recognized the sequentiality inherent in exponentiation
                when the exponentiation sequence itself must be
                computed. <strong>However, the verification was
                missing.</strong> The puzzle creator knew the primes
                <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> forming
                <code>N</code>, allowing <em>them</em> to compute
                <code>y</code> efficiently using Euler’s theorem
                (<code>y = 2^(2^T mod φ(N)) mod N</code>), but anyone
                else had to perform the <code>T</code> sequential
                squarings. There was no way for the creator to
                <em>prove</em> to someone else that <code>y</code> was
                correct without revealing <code>φ(N)</code> (equivalent
                to factoring <code>N</code>), which would break the
                puzzle. Rivest et al. achieved sequential delay but
                lacked <em>efficient public verifiability</em>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Intervening Years:</strong> The need
                for “time” in crypto persisted. Proofs of Work emerged
                as a decentralized, probabilistic timing mechanism, but
                with massive energy costs and parallelism
                vulnerabilities. Concepts like “timed commitments” and
                “verifiable encryption” explored binding secrets to time
                or gradual release, but often relied on different
                mechanisms or lacked the specific combination of public
                verifiability and inherent sequentiality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Aha!” Moment (2018):</strong> The
                critical leap, crystallizing the concept and coining the
                term “Verifiable Delay Function,” is attributed to Dan
                Boneh, Joseph Bonneau, Benedikt Bünz, and Ben Fisch in
                their seminal paper “<strong><a
                href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf">Verifiable
                Delay Functions</a></strong>.” Building on Pietrzak and
                Wesolowski’s concurrent and independent work on Proofs
                of Exponentiation, they formalized the three defining
                properties (Sequentiality, Soundness, Uniqueness) and
                provided the first comprehensive security definitions
                and constructions. The key insight was recognizing
                <strong>verifiability</strong> – specifically, efficient
                verification <em>without</em> compromising the
                sequentiality or requiring secret knowledge held only by
                the prover – as the crucial differentiator from prior
                art like time-lock puzzles. Boneh recounts the naming
                moment occurring during discussions at Stanford, where
                the descriptive phrase “Verifiable Delay Function”
                perfectly captured the essence of this new primitive
                they were rigorously defining. The term rapidly gained
                universal adoption.</p></li>

                <p>The evolution from “time-lock puzzle” to “Verifiable
                Delay Function” represents a shift in focus: from
                primarily <em>hiding a secret</em> bound by time to
                primarily <em>proving the passage of sequential
                computation time</em> on a public input. This shift
                unlocked the potential for VDFs to act as decentralized
                clocks and randomness sources in systems like
                blockchains, setting the stage for the transformative
                applications explored later in this encyclopedia
                entry.</p>
                <p>The concept of Verifiable Delay Functions, formally
                defined and distinguished by its three pillars, thus
                emerges as a cryptographic cornerstone for decentralized
                time. It solves the enigma of proving sequential
                computational effort with near-instant verification.
                Yet, this elegant solution did not spring forth fully
                formed. Its genesis lies in decades of cryptographic
                exploration grappling with the elusive nature of time in
                digital systems. To understand the true significance of
                VDFs, we must now journey back through their
                intellectual prehistory, examining the precursors,
                motivations, and incremental breakthroughs that paved
                the way for Boneh et al.’s pivotal synthesis.</p>

                <p>The elegant formalism of Verifiable Delay Functions,
                with its triad of Sequentiality, Soundness, and
                Uniqueness enabling instant verification of elapsed
                computational time, represents a pinnacle of
                cryptographic abstraction. Yet, like many conceptual
                breakthroughs, it emerged not in a vacuum, but as the
                culmination of decades wrestling with a fundamental
                problem: how to imbue decentralized digital systems with
                a trustworthy sense of <em>time</em>. The story of VDFs
                is intrinsically linked to the persistent desire to
                create “cryptographic clocks” – mechanisms resistant to
                manipulation, capable of enforcing delays, generating
                randomness, or timestamping events without reliance on a
                centralized authority. Before the term “VDF” was coined
                in 2018, cryptographers explored ingenious, albeit
                incomplete, solutions. This section delves into that
                rich prehistory, examining the sparks that ignited the
                VDF revolution and the limitations that ultimately
                necessitated its formal birth.</p>

                The RSA Time-Lock Puzzle (1996): Rivest, Shamir, and
                Wagner’s Spark</h3>
                <p>The genesis of the core idea underpinning many VDFs
                can be traced unambiguously to a single, seminal paper:
                “Time-Lock Puzzles and Timed-Release Crypto” by Ron
                Rivest, Adi Shamir (both Turing Award laureates for
                their work on RSA), and David Wagner, published in 1996.
                Their work was motivated by a problem both practical and
                evocative: <strong>How do you send a message into the
                future?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The Concept: Verifiable Time
                Capsules.</strong> Rivest et al. envisioned scenarios
                like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Bidding on a contract where bids must remain
                sealed until a specific future date.</p></li>
                <li><p>Archiving secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys,
                embarrassing documents, proof of prior art) to be
                revealed only after a predetermined period.</p></li>
                <li><p>Creating “digital time capsules” commemorating
                events, set to open on significant
                anniversaries.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The challenge was ensuring the secret <em>could
                not</em> be opened before the specified time, even by
                powerful adversaries, but <em>could</em> be opened
                efficiently once the time arrived. Crucially, the puzzle
                creator (say, Alice) needed a way to <em>prove</em> to
                the future solver (Bob) that she had indeed locked the
                secret with the intended delay, without giving Bob a way
                to open it prematurely. This latter aspect hinted at
                verifiability but, as we’ll see, fell short.</p>
                <p><strong>The Ingenious Construction: Squaring in the
                Dark.</strong> The Rivest-Shamir-Wagner (RSW) scheme
                leveraged the computational asymmetry inherent in RSA
                cryptography. Here’s a detailed breakdown:</p>

                <em>Crucially, Alice does NOT compute <code>a_T</code>

                <p><strong>Achieving Sequentiality, Lacking
                Verifiability.</strong> The RSW construction brilliantly
                achieved the core property of
                <strong>sequentiality</strong>. It forced the solver to
                expend a minimum amount of <em>sequential</em>
                computational time, proportional to <code>T</code>, to
                unlock the secret. This was a monumental leap, providing
                the first practical cryptographic mechanism for
                enforcing a time delay based on computation rather than
                trusted hardware or real-world clocks. The security
                relied on the assumed hardness of factoring
                <code>N</code> to compute <code>φ(N)</code> quickly, and
                crucially, on the sequential nature of exponentiation
                when the exponent itself must be computed sequentially
                (<code>2^T</code> requires <code>T</code> squarings if
                you can’t compute <code>2^T mod φ(N)</code> first).</p>
                <p><strong>The Fatal Flaw: The Verification
                Gap.</strong> While Alice could efficiently compute
                <code>a_T</code> using <code>φ(N)</code>, she had
                <strong>no efficient way to prove to Bob, <em>before he
                solved it</em>, that <code>K_lock</code> was correctly
                constructed to require exactly <code>T</code>
                squarings</strong>. Any proof she could offer would
                essentially involve revealing information equivalent to
                <code>φ(N)</code> or the result <code>a_T</code> itself,
                which would immediately allow Bob to recover
                <code>K</code> without doing the work, defeating the
                purpose. As Rivest himself noted, “The problem is that
                the puzzle constructor is in a privileged position; he
                knows the answer already.” The only way for Bob to gain
                confidence in the puzzle was to partially solve it
                himself for a smaller <code>T'</code> and verify that
                intermediate result matched what he got, but this was
                cumbersome, inefficient, and didn’t scale or provide
                strong guarantees for the full <code>T</code>. The RSW
                puzzle provided sequential delay and eventual
                correctness (once solved), but lacked the
                <strong>efficient public verifiability</strong> that
                defines a VDF. It was a time-lock, but not a verifiably
                <em>delayed function</em> in the modern sense.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact and Legacy:</strong> Despite lacking
                verifiability, the RSW paper was revolutionary. It
                introduced the core sequential computation primitive
                (repeated squaring in groups of unknown order) that
                underpins the most efficient VDFs today. It clearly
                articulated the need and provided a powerful solution
                for the timed-release aspect. Its influence is
                undeniable; Pietrzak’s and Wesolowski’s VDFs can be seen
                as direct descendants, solving the verifiability problem
                that RSW left open. The paper also sparked broader
                interest in “timed cryptography,” inspiring research
                into related concepts like timed commitments and
                verifiable encryption. The RSW puzzle remains a
                foundational cryptographic concept, a testament to its
                elegant design, even as its limitations paved the way
                for the VDF evolution.</p>

                Proofs of Work (PoW) and the Quest for Decentralized
                Time</h3>
                <p>While Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner tackled the problem
                of <em>enforcing</em> a specific time delay, another
                strand of research emerged from the burgeoning field of
                decentralized systems, particularly with the rise of
                peer-to-peer networks and, later, blockchain technology.
                Here, the challenge wasn’t just enforcing a delay, but
                <strong>creating a decentralized, shared sense of time
                and randomness</strong> without any central coordinator.
                This need found its most prominent, albeit deeply
                flawed, answer in <strong>Proofs of Work
                (PoW)</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>PoW as Decentralized, Probabilistic
                Timekeeping:</strong> Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin
                whitepaper (2008) didn’t invent PoW (concepts like
                Hashcash by Adam Back existed earlier), but it
                brilliantly repurposed it as the engine for
                decentralized consensus. PoW’s role in Bitcoin is
                multifaceted: it secures the network against Sybil
                attacks, enables decentralized minting of new coins
                (mining), and, crucially, <strong>creates a
                probabilistic notion of elapsed time between
                blocks.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Miners compete to
                find a “nonce” value such that when combined with the
                new block’s data and the previous block’s hash, the
                resulting hash output (e.g., SHA-256) is below a
                specific target value. This target is dynamically
                adjusted by the protocol to maintain an average time
                between blocks (e.g., 10 minutes for Bitcoin).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Time via Difficulty:</strong> The target
                value determines the <em>difficulty</em> of the PoW. A
                lower target means fewer valid hash outputs exist,
                making it statistically harder to find a valid nonce.
                The average time to find a block is inversely
                proportional to the total computational power (hash
                rate) dedicated to mining. By adjusting the target based
                on the observed block times, the protocol aims to keep
                the <em>average</em> inter-block interval
                constant.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Anyone can
                participate in mining. The longest valid chain, defined
                by the cumulative PoW difficulty, represents the
                canonical history. This creates a decentralized “clock”
                where the passage of time is marked by the addition of
                new blocks secured by PoW. Block height becomes a proxy
                for time.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Critical Limitations of PoW as a Timing
                Primitive:</strong> While PoW powered the first
                successful decentralized digital currency, its use as a
                timing mechanism for applications <em>beyond</em> simple
                block intervals is riddled with problems that directly
                fueled the search for VDFs:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Massive Energy Waste:</strong> PoW is
                intentionally computationally expensive. Miners perform
                quintillions of hash computations per second globally
                (Bitcoin alone consumes more electricity annually than
                many countries), the vast majority of which are
                discarded as they don’t find a valid solution. This
                “waste” is fundamental to its security model – making
                attacks expensive. However, for the purpose of
                <em>just</em> creating a time delay or randomness, this
                energy expenditure is seen as increasingly unsustainable
                and ethically problematic. As Vitalik Buterin,
                co-founder of Ethereum, stated, “Proof of work is a huge
                economic waste unless it is securing something that is
                worth at least as much as the cost of the electricity.”
                VDFs promised the sequential delay guarantee
                <em>without</em> the massive parallel waste.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lack of Unique Outputs:</strong> PoW
                puzzles typically have <em>many</em> valid solutions
                (nonces). Miners search the nonce space until they find
                <em>any</em> value that produces a hash below the
                target. This has two critical implications:</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Grinding Attacks:</strong> An adversary
                with significant computational resources can often
                compute <em>multiple</em> valid blocks at the same
                height (forking the chain) or compute <em>multiple</em>
                potential future blocks. This allows them to choose
                which block to publish based on advantageous outcomes
                (e.g., including or excluding specific transactions,
                maximizing miner extractable value (MEV)). The lack of
                uniqueness enables manipulation of the system’s state
                based on the PoW result.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unpredictability
                vs. Unbiasability:</strong> While the <em>winning</em>
                nonce for a block appears random, the <em>process</em>
                is vulnerable to bias. The miner who finds the solution
                decides which transactions are included. If the miner
                has a stake in the outcome of certain events determined
                by the block hash (e.g., a lottery result), they can
                choose to withhold a valid block and try to find another
                one that produces a more favorable hash outcome,
                introducing bias. This is distinct from the
                unpredictability of <em>who</em> solves it, but
                critically impacts applications relying on the output’s
                <em>fairness</em>.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="3" type="1">
                <li><strong>Vulnerability to ASICs and
                Centralization:</strong> PoW algorithms like SHA-256 are
                highly parallelizable. This led to an arms race where
                specialized hardware (Application-Specific Integrated
                Circuits - ASICs) was developed to compute the specific
                hash function orders of magnitude faster and more
                efficiently than general-purpose CPUs or GPUs. This
                resulted in:</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Centralization Pressure:</strong> Mining
                became dominated by large, well-capitalized entities
                operating massive ASIC farms, concentrating power and
                potentially undermining the decentralized ideal.
                Geographic centralization also occurred near cheap
                energy sources.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Barrier to Entry:</strong> The cost and
                expertise required to design and manufacture competitive
                ASICs created high barriers to entry for new
                participants.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Monoculture:</strong> The
                security of the network became heavily dependent on the
                continued hardness of one specific computational problem
                (e.g., SHA-256 preimage resistance) for which ASICs are
                optimized. VDF research was partly motivated by the
                desire for primitives less susceptible to extreme ASIC
                speedups, potentially through memory-hardness or
                inherent sequentiality.</p></li>

                <ol start="4" type="1">
                <li><strong>Probabilistic, Not Deterministic
                Timing:</strong> PoW provides only a
                <em>probabilistic</em> guarantee about the time between
                blocks. While the average is targeted, the actual time
                can vary significantly (e.g., Bitcoin blocks sometimes
                take minutes, sometimes hours). For applications
                requiring a precise minimum delay (e.g., ensuring a bid
                cannot be front-run because it takes exactly 1 minute to
                compute the opening), PoW is unsuitable. VDFs offer
                deterministic sequential delay.</li>

                <p><strong>The Desire for “Better PoW”: Fueling VDF
                Research:</strong> The limitations of PoW, particularly
                its energy consumption, lack of uniqueness, and ASIC
                vulnerability, became increasingly apparent as
                blockchain technology matured and explored more complex
                applications beyond simple value transfer. Projects like
                Ethereum, aiming for a “world computer,” grappled with
                the need for fair randomness (e.g., for sharding, leader
                election, lotteries) and MEV mitigation. PoW was clearly
                inadequate for these tasks. The search intensified for a
                cryptographic primitive that could provide:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Deterministic Sequential Delay:</strong>
                Guaranteeing a minimum computation time.</p></li>

                parallel waste to necessary sequential work.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The RSA Time-Lock Puzzle demonstrated inherent
                sequentiality but lacked verifiability. PoW provided a
                form of decentralized timing but with massive waste and
                lack of uniqueness. The stage was set. The convergence
                of these strands – the need for decentralized
                time/randomness in blockchains, the limitations of PoW,
                and the foundational idea of sequential computation from
                time-lock puzzles – created the perfect intellectual
                environment. Cryptographers began asking: <em>Could the
                sequential core of the time-lock puzzle be combined with
                a succinct proof system to achieve both verifiability
                and delay? Could this create the “better PoW” for timing
                and randomness?</em> This question became the catalyst
                for the breakthroughs of 2018.</p>
                <p>The rise of Ethereum, with its explicit goals of
                supporting complex decentralized applications (dApps)
                and mitigating MEV, provided a powerful practical
                driver. The Ethereum Foundation recognized the potential
                early, launching a dedicated <strong><a

                Inherent Sequentiality: Why Can’t We Speed This Up?</h3>
                <p>At the heart of every VDF lies a computational task
                that is <em>inherently sequential</em>. Unlike
                parallelizable problems (e.g., searching a keyspace or
                rendering pixels), these tasks possess a strict
                dependency chain where each step fundamentally requires
                the output of the previous one. This linearity creates
                an insurmountable barrier to parallel acceleration. But
                how do we mathematically formalize and guarantee this
                property?</p>
                <p><strong>The Nature of Sequential
                Computation:</strong> Consider the simple act of
                climbing a ladder. Each rung must be traversed in order;
                attempting to skip rungs is impossible without external
                aids. Similarly, inherently sequential computations have
                a “critical path” length that dictates the minimum
                possible execution time, regardless of processor count.
                This contrasts with parallelizable tasks like sorting a
                list with merge-sort, where subtrees can be processed
                independently. The critical metric is
                <strong>computational depth</strong>—the length of the
                longest chain of dependent operations.</p>
                <p><strong>Depth-Robust Graphs: The Combinatorial
                Engine:</strong> The theoretical foundation for
                enforcing sequentiality in VDFs often relies on
                <strong>depth-robust graphs (DRGs)</strong>. These
                directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) possess a remarkable
                property: even after removing a large fraction of nodes
                (or edges), the longest path (the depth) remains
                substantial. This resilience ensures that an adversary
                cannot “short-circuit” the computation by precomputing
                or parallelizing key subcomponents.</p>

                depth-robustness. Removing even 50% of nodes might only
                reduce the depth by a constant factor, not polynomially.
                For instance, the graph family proposed by Erdős,
                Graham, and Szemerédi achieves depth robustness where
                depth<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>is linear in

                <li><p><strong>Role in VDFs:</strong> To build a VDF,
                one can define a computation where the output depends on
                evaluating a path through a depth-robust graph. Each
                node represents a computation (e.g., applying a hash
                function), and edges enforce dependencies. An adversary
                wishing to compute the output faster might precompute
                values for a subset of nodes. However, depth-robustness
                guarantees that no matter which nodes are precomputed, a
                long sequential path (of length proportional to <span
                class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) <em>must</em> still be
                traversed at the time of evaluation. This forces the
                adversary to perform nearly the same sequential work as
                an honest party. While practical VDFs like Pietrzak’s
                often use simpler sequential chains (like repeated
                squaring), their security proofs frequently reduce to
                the hardness of finding shortcuts in depth-robust
                computations or related structures. DRGs provide the
                theoretical justification that such shortcuts are
                computationally infeasible.</p></li>

                Algebraic Structures: Groups of Unknown Order</h3>
                <p>The most efficient and widely studied VDFs derive
                their sequentiality not from complex graph traversals,
                but from the elegant computational asymmetry within
                specific algebraic structures: <strong>groups of unknown
                order</strong>. These groups provide the fertile ground
                where repeated squaring—or similar inherently sequential
                operations—blossoms into a robust VDF.</p>
                <p><strong>Definition and Significance:</strong> A group
                <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}\)</span>is “of
                unknown order” if the number of elements in the group
                (its order, denoted<span
                class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{G}|\)</span>or<span
                class="math inline">\(\phi(N)\)</span>in multiplicative
                notation) is computationally infeasible to determine for
                anyone without privileged knowledge. This property is
                crucial because knowing the group order often enables
                drastic computational shortcuts via Lagrange’s Theorem
                (which states that<span

                <li><p><strong>Post-Quantum Security:</strong> The
                security relies on the computational hardness of finding
                paths (isogenies) between given supersingular curves.
                This <strong>Supersingular Isogeny Path Problem</strong>
                is believed to be resistant to quantum computers, making
                these VDFs promising for a quantum future.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Construction Principles:</strong> Schemes
                like De Feo-Masson-Petit-Sanso (2019) define VDFs based
                on isogeny walks. The prover computes the walk and
                generates a proof, often involving points on
                intermediate curves or dual isogenies, allowing the
                verifier to check the path validity without rewalking
                it.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unique Properties:</strong> Unlike
                RSA/class groups, the “group” structure here is less
                direct; the sequentiality comes from the path traversal
                itself. The output (a curve) is naturally unique for a
                given path.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Current Limitations:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Isogeny computation
                is significantly more complex than modular
                exponentiation or ideal squaring. Each step involves
                intricate arithmetic in high-degree extension
                fields.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Size and Verification:</strong>
                Succinct proofs for isogeny walks are harder to
                construct and larger than PoE proofs. Verification,
                while faster than evaluation, is slower than RSA/class
                group VDFs (often polynomial in <span
                class="math inline">\(\log T\)</span>, not
                constant).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parameter Sizes:</strong> Achieving
                comparable security levels to RSA-3072 might require
                larger field sizes, impacting performance and
                storage.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State of Research:</strong> Active work
                focuses on optimization (e.g., faster isogeny formulas
                using projective coordinates, optimized field
                arithmetic), smaller proofs (using inner-product
                arguments or recursive composition), and exploring
                different isogeny degrees or graph structures. Projects
                like the Supersingular Isogeny VDF (SI-VDF) by the

                <p>The security of VDFs—their sequentiality, soundness,

                well-defined computational hardness assumptions.
                Breaking these assumptions would compromise the VDF.
                Understanding them is paramount.</p>

                formalizes the belief that repeated squaring is the
                <em>only</em> way to compute high iterated powers
                without knowing the group order. Depth-robust graph
                constructions can sometimes reduce to weaker or

                of failed attempts to find shortcuts for exponentiation
                without group order knowledge. Its difficulty is closely
                related to the factoring problem for RSA groups. A break
                would imply either a fundamental advance in integer
                factorization or a novel algebraic method for
                accelerating iterated squaring.</p></li>

                <strong>crucial for soundness proofs</strong> in
                Wesolowski-like and Pietrzak VDFs. The proof generation
                relies on the prover extracting roots (e.g., <span

                computations, even with quantum computers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Role:</strong> This is the
                <strong>sequentiality assumption</strong> for

                or using parallel computation to simulate the walk

                standardization (e.g., SIKE, though broken in practice
                recently using classical attacks, highlighting the need
                for careful parameter choice). While the
                <em>sequential</em> aspect adds nuance, the hardness of
                finding <em>any</em> path provides strong foundational

                faster than the prescribed delay <span

                sequentiality guarantee. Time-based randomness beacons
                could be predicted, MEV protections bypassed, and
                consensus protocols undermined.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Breaking LOA/ARA:</strong> An adversary

                uniqueness, allowing the attacker to manipulate outcomes
                (e.g., choosing favorable randomness). The entire trust
                model of the VDF would collapse.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Breaking Factoring/Isogeny Path:</strong>

                intractability of problems that have withstood decades
                of cryptanalysis—and, in the case of isogenies, the hope
                for quantum resistance. This mathematical foundation

                <p><strong>The Role of Wesolowski’s PoE
                Insight:</strong> While Pietrzak developed his recursive
                protocol independently, the core mechanism relies on a
                <strong>Proof of Exponentiation (PoE)</strong>. Each
                recursive step proves that <span
                class="math inline">\(\mu =
                g&#39;^{2^{T/2^k}}\)</span>without revealing the full
                exponent. The security reduces to the Adaptive Root
                Assumption: if an adversary could find a<span
                class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-th root for a randomly
                chosen challenge <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>,
                they could break the soundness of the recursive
                proof.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Proof Sketch:</strong> Under the
                Sequential Root Assumption (SRA) and the Adaptive Root
                Assumption (ARA) in the generic group model, Pietrzak’s
                VDF satisfies sequentiality and soundness. An adversary
                winning the soundness game could be used to extract a
                root violating ARA, while sequentiality follows directly
                from SRA given the iterative squaring structure.
                Uniqueness stems from the deterministic computation in a
                group.</p>

                <li><p><strong>Verification Speed:</strong> Wesolowski
                requires 2 exponentiations with <em>small</em> exponents
                (<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, <span

                multiplication, independent of <span

                adds one large exponentiation (computing<span

                planned VDF-based randomness beacon and Filecoin’s

                <p><strong>The “Wesolowski vs. Pietrzak”
                Misconception:</strong> While often presented as
                competing schemes, they are complementary realizations
                of the same core idea (PoE over sequential squaring)
                using different proof techniques. Wesolowski’s proof is
                smaller and verification faster for large <span
                class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, while Pietrzak’s
                recursive structure offers different advantages in
                specific contexts like distributed VDFs or when proof
                aggregation patterns align with recursion levels. Many
                implementations reference the “Wesolowski VDF,”
                acknowledging his breakthrough in constant-sized

                Chia’s Class Group VDF: Democracy Through Transparent
                Setup</h3>
                <p>The Achilles’ heel of RSA-based VDFs (Pietrzak,
                Wesolowski) is the <strong>trusted setup</strong> of the
                modulus <span class="math inline">\(N = pq\)</span>.
                Whoever generates <span
                class="math inline">\(N\)</span>knows the group
                order<span class="math inline">\(\phi(N)\)</span> and
                can compute VDF outputs instantly, bypassing the
                sequential delay. While Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
                ceremonies mitigate this (e.g., the RSA Factoring
                Challenge), they are complex, costly, and introduce
                procedural trust. Bram Cohen’s Chia Network addressed
                this head-on by adopting <strong>class groups of
                imaginary quadratic fields</strong>, enabling a
                completely transparent setup.</p>
                <p><strong>Motivation: Removing the Trusted Third Party
                (TTP):</strong> Chia’s blockchain consensus (“Proof of
                Space and Time”) relies heavily on VDFs for timing
                between blocks. Requiring a trusted setup for a core
                security component was anathema to their
                decentralization ethos. Class groups offered a solution:
                the defining discriminant <span
                class="math inline">\(-D\)</span>could be generated
                publicly from a random beacon (e.g., Bitcoin block
                hash), and crucially, <strong>computing the class
                number<span class="math inline">\(h(-D)\)</span>(the
                group order) is believed to be as hard as solving the
                discrete logarithm problem in the class group or
                factoring<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>

                operations (ideal multiplication, reduction, equivalence
                testing) are significantly more complex than modular
                integer arithmetic. A single class group op can be
                100-1000x slower than a modular multiplication in <span

                efficient ideal multiplication.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Performance Trade-off:</strong> Despite

                squaring. However, the transparent setup is a critical
                advantage for decentralization. Verification, involving
                a few class group ops with small exponents (<span
                class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, <span

                (vs. 2048-bit RSA moduli), but the complexity of group
                ops dominates performance, not the bit length.</p></li>

                <p><strong>Chia’s Real-World Deployment:</strong> Chia
                Network integrated this class group VDF (specifically
                Wesolowski-style) as the “Time” component in its “Proof
                of Space and Time” consensus. Farmers (who provide
                storage proofs) generate VDF proofs on winning
                challenges, ensuring a minimum time elapses between
                blocks and preventing grinding attacks. The transparent
                setup aligns with Chia’s vision of a more decentralized
                and sustainable blockchain compared to PoW. Their
                open-source implementation (<code>chiavdf</code>) serves
                as a valuable reference for class group
                cryptography.</p>
                <p><strong>The Setup Advantage:</strong> The ability to
                generate <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> publicly
                from a random seed eliminated a major point of
                centralization and attack surface present in RSA VDFs.
                While class groups are less efficient and their security
                less battle-tested than RSA, the trade-off for trust
                minimization was deemed essential for Chia’s goals.</p>

                Supersingular isogeny VDFs represent the frontier of
                post-quantum sequential computation. While impractical
                for near-term deployment in high-throughput systems like
                Ethereum’s beacon chain, they offer a viable, if
                challenging, path toward verifiable delay functions that
                remain secure even in the quantum era. Their development
                is a critical insurance policy for the long-term future
                of decentralized timekeeping.</p>
                <p>The construction of verifiable delay
                functions—whether through the optimized squaring of
                Pietrzak and Wesolowski, the trust-minimized class
                groups of Chia, or the quantum-resistant
                isogenies—demonstrates the remarkable versatility of
                cryptographic ingenuity. Each scheme translates the
                abstract requirements of sequentiality and verifiability
                into concrete algorithms, leveraging different
                mathematical landscapes to build the essential clocks
                for decentralized systems. Yet, constructing the clock
                is only the first step. Securing its initial
                configuration, choosing its timing parameters, and
                defending against real-world attacks present a new set

                The Setup Phase: Trusted, Transparent, or Nothing?</h3>
                <p>The very first step in deploying a VDF—generating its
                public parameters (<code>pp</code>)—can be its most
                critical vulnerability. The security model hinges
                fundamentally on how this setup is performed and what
                trust assumptions it entails. Different VDF families
                demand radically different approaches:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>RSA Modulus Setup: The Perennial Trusted
                Setup Problem:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Core Issue:</strong> For Pietrzak and
                Wesolowski VDFs, <code>pp</code> includes an RSA modulus
                <code>N = p * q</code>, where <code>p</code> and
                <code>q</code> are large, randomly generated primes
                (ideally safe primes: <code>p = 2p'+1</code>,
                <code>q=2q'+1</code> with <code>p', q'</code> also
                prime). <strong>Anyone who knows <code>p</code> and
                <code>q</code> (and thus <code>φ(N)</code>) can compute
                <code>g^{2^T} mod N</code> <em>instantly</em> using
                Euler’s theorem (<code>g^{2^T mod φ(N)} mod N</code>),
                completely bypassing the sequential delay
                <code>T</code>.</strong> This renders the VDF useless
                for its intended purpose.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Risk:</strong> If the entity
                generating <code>N</code> retains <code>p</code> and
                <code>q</code>, they wield an undetectable backdoor. If
                <code>p</code> or <code>q</code> is leaked or stolen,
                any attacker gains the same power. The security
                collapses if the modulus is factored.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation: Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
                Ceremonies:</strong> To distribute trust, MPC protocols
                allow multiple parties to collaboratively generate
                <code>N</code> such that:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>No Single Entity Knows the
                Factors:</strong> The computation ensures <code>p</code>
                and <code>q</code> are never known in full by any single
                participant or small coalition.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Output is Verifiably Correct:</strong>
                Participants can cryptographically verify that
                <code>N</code> is indeed a product of two large primes
                (or at least square-free and hard to factor) without
                learning the factors.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Secure Deletion:</strong> After
                generation, each participant securely erases their
                private shares of the computation, leaving only the
                public <code>N</code>.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Protocol:</strong> Used the <a

                individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds
                (cryptographers, developers, artists, Ethereum community
                members) contributed unique entropy.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Participants ran
                specialized software locally, contributing secret
                shares. The final modulus <code>N</code> was computed
                only after sufficient contributions were aggregated.
                Each participant could cryptographically verify the
                correctness of their contribution’s inclusion and the
                final modulus structure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges &amp; Outcome:</strong> While
                a triumph of decentralized collaboration, the ceremony
                faced logistical hurdles (software compatibility,
                participant onboarding) and highlighted the inherent
                complexity. Crucially, <strong>the ceremony was
                completed successfully, producing a trusted
                modulus.</strong> However, the planned integration of
                VDFs into Ethereum was subsequently deferred for other
                reasons (complexity, ASIC risk). The ceremony stands as
                a model for future large-scale trusted setups.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Residual Risks of MPC:</strong> While
                vastly reducing risk, MPC ceremonies aren’t
                foolproof:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Coalition Attacks:</strong> A
                sufficiently large, covertly colluding subset of
                participants <em>could</em> potentially reconstruct the
                factors.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implementation Bugs:</strong> Flaws in
                the MPC protocol or software could leak secrets or
                produce an insecure <code>N</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Long-Term Security:</strong> The security
                relies on the modulus never being factored. Advances in
                factoring algorithms (classical or quantum) pose a
                long-term threat. The chosen modulus size (e.g., 2048
                bits) provides a security level based on current
                knowledge.</p></li>

                (the group order) or solving the discrete logarithm

                <li><p><strong>Randomness Beacons (e.g., Ethereum

                output within the timescale of relevant actions (e.g.,
                block proposal). If <code>T</code> is too short, a miner

                time and only publish the one most favorable to them
                (“grinding”). Ethereum initially targeted

                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation / Fair Ordering:</strong>
                <code>T</code> needs to be long enough to ensure bids or

                observing the mempool. Values might range from seconds

                defines the <em>minimum sequential computation
                time</em>. The <em>actual wall-clock time</em> depends
                on the speed of the underlying operation (modular
                squaring, class group op, isogeny step) on the fastest
                available hardware (CPUs, FPGAs, ASICs).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Estimating Wall-Clock Time:</strong>
                Requires benchmarking the core sequential operation
                (<code>op</code>) on target hardware. Wall-clock time
                <code>≈ T * time_per_op</code>.</p></li>

                A modern CPU core might perform ~10^4 modular squarings
                (2048-bit) per second. For <code>T = 10^9</code>,
                evaluation takes ~10^9 / 10^4 = 10^5 seconds ≈ 27.7
                hours. An FPGA or ASIC could be 10-100x faster, reducing
                this to hours or minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia Class Group:</strong> Due to slower
                operations (~10^2 ops/sec per core for 1024-bit disc.),
                achieving <code>T=10^9</code> might take weeks on CPUs,

                honest evaluators. Smaller <code>T</code> improves
                responsiveness but weakens security. Finding the
                “Goldilocks zone” is application-specific and requires
                careful modeling of adversary capabilities.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>RSA Modulus (<code>|N|</code>):</strong>
                Security against factoring dictates modulus size. For
                <code>λ=128</code>, <code>|N| = 3072-4096 bits</code> is
                recommended (NIST guidelines), significantly larger than
                for traditional RSA encryption (~2048 bits) due to the
                long-term nature of the modulus and the catastrophic
                impact of factoring. The Ethereum MPC targeted 2048 bits
                for pragmatic reasons (ceremony complexity, evaluation
                speed), accepting a security level slightly below 128
                bits (~110 bits) for the planned delay times and
                considering the MPC overhead for attackers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Class Group Discriminant
                (<code>|D|</code>):</strong> The discriminant size
                needed for <code>λ=128</code> is smaller than equivalent
                RSA moduli, typically around
                <code>|D| = 1024 bits</code>. This is because the
                best-known attacks on class group discrete logs (or
                computing the class number) have complexity roughly
                exponential in the <em>square root</em> of the
                discriminant size. However, the much slower group
                operation dominates practical performance

                <li><p><strong>Isogeny Characteristic
                (<code>|p|</code>):</strong> SI-VDF security scales with

                Achieving <code>λ=128</code> post-quantum security
                likely requires <code>|p|</code> in the range of
                <strong>2000-4000 bits</strong>, translating to large
                field elements and computationally expensive arithmetic.
                This is a major contributor to their current
                impracticality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact on Performance:</strong> Larger
                groups (more bits) mean slower group operations
                (squaring, multiplication). This linearly impacts
                evaluation time (<code>T * time_per_op</code>). It also
                increases proof sizes (Wesolowski <code>π</code> is one
                group element) and verification costs (exponentiations
                involve larger elements). Parameter selection is a

                interactive arguments).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implication:</strong> The security of the
                VDF is only as strong as the underlying assumption. If
                factoring falls to a quantum computer, RSA/Class Group
                VDFs are broken. If efficient isogeny path algorithms
                are found, SI-VDFs are broken.</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Low-Order Elements (RSA/Class
                Groups):</strong> A critical threat to soundness. If the
                group contains an element <code>g</code> of small order
                <code>q</code> (<code>g^q = 1</code>), a malicious
                prover could exploit it to forge proofs.
                <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use <strong>safe
                primes</strong> for RSA moduli
                (<code>p=2p'+1, q=2q'+1</code> with <code>p', q'</code>
                prime), ensuring the multiplicative group has large
                order. For class groups, the structure inherently
                resists small subgroups, but care is still needed in
                implementations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Precomputation Limits:</strong> The
                sequentiality guarantee assumes the adversary cannot
                perform significant <em>input-specific</em>
                precomputation before learning <code>x</code>.
                <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Ensure <code>x</code> is
                sufficiently random/unpredictable (e.g., derived from
                blockchain state or a strong hash). The security model
                explicitly allows bounded <code>poly(λ)</code> generic
                precomputation independent of <code>x</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verification Spoofing:</strong> While the
                proof <code>π</code> ensures the output <code>y</code>
                is correct <em>for the given input <code>x</code> and
                parameters <code>pp</code></em>, it doesn’t guarantee
                the evaluator used the correct <code>T</code>. A lazy
                evaluator could run <code>Eval</code> with a smaller
                <code>T' &lt; T</code> and generate a valid proof for
                the incorrect <code>y'</code>.
                <strong>Mitigation:</strong> The protocol must enforce
                that the claimed <code>T</code> is the correct one
                (e.g., hardcoded in smart contracts, verified
                off-chain). This is an <strong>external

                <li><p><strong>The Reality:</strong> ASICs/FPGAs
                <em>will</em> be developed for profitable VDFs (like

                (efficiency).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Threat:</strong> Extreme ASIC
                speedups could:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Centralize Evaluation:</strong>

                owners, undermining decentralization goals (especially
                if VDFs are used in consensus).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Reduce Effective Delay:</strong> If ASICs
                make wall-clock evaluation time much faster than
                anticipated for a given <code>T</code>, the security
                margin against grinding attacks erodes. An adversary
                with the best ASICs could compute more options within a

                improve, maintaining the target wall-clock delay and
                security margin. Requires flexible governance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory-Hard Layers:</strong> Integrate a
                memory-hard function (like Argon2, Balloon, or Equihash)
                <em>alongside</em> the sequential VDF core. The idea is
                to make the cost of building an ASIC dominated by
                expensive memory (RAM) rather than cheap logic gates,
                reducing the potential speedup advantage and keeping
                hardware more commoditized. <strong>Ethereum’s VDF plans
                heavily emphasized this approach.</strong> Research into
                <strong>VDF + MHF</strong> combinations is active.

                influence over it) to find an <code>x</code> leading to

                Unbiased Randomness Beacons: The Holy Grail</h3>
                <p>The quest for decentralized, trustworthy randomness
                is a foundational challenge in distributed systems.
                Randomness underpins fair leader election, secure
                lotteries, unpredictable gaming outcomes, unbiased jury
                selection in DAOs, and secure parameter generation. Yet,
                achieving randomness that is simultaneously
                <em>public</em>, <em>unpredictable</em>,
                <em>unbiasable</em>, and <em>verifiable</em> has been
                the elusive “Holy Grail.” Traditional approaches
                falter:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Pre-Commit/Reveal Schemes:</strong>
                Participants commit to random seeds, then later reveal
                them. The combined seeds generate the output.
                <strong>Flaw:</strong> The last participant to reveal
                (the “last-revealer”) can see all prior seeds and choose
                their own to manipulate the final result. This is the
                <strong>last-revealer attack</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verifiable Random Functions
                (VRFs):</strong> Provide cryptographic proofs that an
                output is unique and derived correctly from a secret key
                and input. <strong>Flaw:</strong> The entity holding the
                secret key controls the randomness. While distributed
                key generation (DKG) mitigates this, it’s complex and
                introduces communication overhead and trust assumptions.
                The output can also be predicted <em>by the key
                holder(s)</em> before being revealed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Blockchain-Derived Randomness (e.g.,
                RANDAO):</strong> Ethereum’s Beacon Chain initially
                relied heavily on <strong>RANDAO</strong>, where
                validators contribute hashes of random numbers in each
                epoch. The final randomness is the XOR of all revealed
                values. <strong>Flaw:</strong> Validators can
                strategically delay their reveals. Seeing most
                contributions, a validator can choose <em>not</em> to
                reveal (sacrificing a small penalty) if the resulting
                randomness would be unfavorable to them, or choose
                <em>when</em> to reveal to influence subsequent steps
                (“grinding attacks”). This introduces
                <strong>bias</strong> and
                <strong>predictability</strong>. As Ethereum researcher
                Justin Drake noted, “RANDAO alone is like a public
                lottery where the last ticket holder gets to peek at all
                other tickets before deciding whether to rip theirs
                up.”</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why VDFs are the Ideal Solution:</strong>
                VDFs solve the core vulnerabilities by imposing an
                <strong>unavoidable, verifiable delay</strong> between
                the commitment to the entropy source and the generation
                of the final random output. This breaks the ability of
                any participant to react to others’ contributions or

                attacks economically irrational: the cost of
                manipulating RANDAO (by withholding reveals) would be
                high, and the VDF delay prevents predicting

                NIST’s Randomness Beacon conceptually demonstrates this
                model. A true VDF-based stand-alone beacon offers
                stronger guarantees against manipulation by the
                operator, as the output <code>y_i</code> is determined
                by the previous public seed <code>x_i</code> and the
                enforced delay. The operator cannot choose the output.
                Transparent setup (like class groups) is ideal here to
                minimize trust. Projects like <strong>drand</strong>

                Enhancing Consensus Protocols: Proof-of-Stake and
                Beyond</h3>
                <p>Consensus protocols enable decentralized networks to
                agree on a single state history. VDFs provide unique
                tools to enhance the security, fairness, and efficiency
                of these protocols, particularly Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
                variants.</p>
                <p><strong>Taming the Nothing-at-Stake Problem:</strong>
                A well-known challenge in PoS is the “nothing-at-stake”
                problem. During a chain fork (temporary disagreement),
                validators have an economic incentive to vote (sign
                blocks) for <em>every</em> potential fork, as signing
                costs little and they might receive rewards on whichever
                fork wins. This can prolong forks and undermine
                finality. While slashing penalties (punishing
                equivocation) mitigate this, VDFs offer an elegant
                temporal solution:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Adding Delay to Finality
                Gadgets:</strong> Protocols like Ethereum’s Gasper
                (combining Casper FFG and LMD-GHOST) use a finality
                gadget to periodically “finalize” blocks (making them
                irreversible without burning a large portion of staked
                ETH). Introducing a mandatory VDF delay <em>after</em> a
                block is proposed but <em>before</em> validators can
                vote on its finality creates a forced waiting
                period.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> When a block
                <code>B</code> is proposed, a VDF is started using
                <code>B</code>’s hash as input. Validators can only cast
                their finality votes for <code>B</code> after the VDF
                output (and proof) is published and verified. This delay
                <code>T</code> (e.g., 1-2 minutes) is significantly
                longer than typical network latency.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> An attacker attempting
                to build a competing fork must now also compute the VDF
                for their malicious block. Crucially, they
                <em>cannot</em> start this VDF computation until
                <em>after</em> they create their fork, which lags behind
                the honest chain. The sequentiality of the VDF prevents
                them from “catching up” quickly enough with parallel
                resources. This gives the honest network time to detect
                the fork and coordinate, making successful long-range
                attacks vastly harder. Validators are also
                disincentivized from voting on multiple forks because
                the VDF delay synchronizes the voting process, making
                equivocation more detectable.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Creating Fair Leader Election:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> In many PoS or
                Proof-of-Space (PoSpace) blockchains, the next block
                proposer (“leader”) is chosen pseudo-randomly based on
                their stake or storage. An adversary who can predict the
                next leader could launch targeted Denial-of-Service
                (DoS) attacks against them.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF Solution:</strong> Use a VDF to delay
                the revelation of the leader until just before they must
                propose. The selection process uses a seed
                <code>x</code> known in advance (e.g., from the previous
                block). The VDF input is <code>x</code> combined with
                the eligible participant’s unique ID. The output
                <code>y</code> determines the leader.
                Crucially:</p></li>
                <li><p>The computation
                <code>y = Eval(pp, x || ID)</code> is specific to each
                participant <code>ID</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Participants start computing their VDF proof as
                soon as <code>x</code> is known.</p></li>
                <li><p>The participant who completes their VDF
                <em>first</em> (i.e., whose computation finishes closest
                to the target slot time) is the leader. They immediately
                broadcast their block <em>and</em> the VDF
                proof.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Due to
                sequentiality, participants cannot predict <em>when</em>
                their VDF will finish relative to others until very near
                the end. This prevents pre-emptive DoS attacks. The
                proof <code>π</code> verifies they were indeed the first
                valid completer. <strong>Filecoin employs this exact
                mechanism</strong> for its expected leader election in
                each round. The VDF delay <code>T</code> is set such
                that the fastest honest participant usually wins, but
                slow networks or adversaries cannot reliably predict
                winners far in advance.</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Chia Paradigm:</strong> Chia
                Network’s consensus mechanism is a prime example of VDFs
                as a core consensus element. It combines:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof of Space (PoSpace):</strong>
                Participants (“farmers”) prove they dedicate unused disk
                space by storing cryptographic plots. Winning a block
                requires finding a plot that matches a
                challenge.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof of Time (VDF):</strong> Crucially,
                winning a PoSpace challenge only qualifies a farmer to
                <em>compete</em> for the block. They must then
                <strong>complete a VDF proof</strong> based on the
                challenge. The <em>first farmer to complete a valid VDF
                proof</em> wins the block.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Role of the VDF:</strong></p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Enforces Minimum Block Time:</strong> The
                VDF computation time <code>T</code> (e.g., targeted at
                ~25 seconds in Chia) sets a hard lower bound on the time
                between blocks. Even if many farmers find valid PoSpace
                solutions simultaneously, only one can complete the VDF
                first. This prevents flooding the network.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Prevents Grinding:</strong> An adversary
                with massive storage could generate many plots. Without
                the VDF, they could instantly scan all plots for a
                winning challenge, potentially grinding through many
                options per second. The VDF forces them to spend
                significant sequential computation time (~25s) <em>per
                winning PoSpace solution</em> before they can claim the
                block, making large-scale grinding economically
                unfeasible. The uniqueness of the VDF output ensures
                only one winner per challenge.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Synergy:</strong> The space acts
                as a Sybil resistance mechanism (costly to acquire),
                while the time ensures fair block pacing and grinding
                resistance. The VDF is the sequential engine that gates
                block production.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Chia uses its class
                group VDF (Wesolowski style) for this purpose,
                leveraging the transparent setup to maintain
                decentralization. The farmer who finds a winning plot
                computes <code>VDF.Eval(pp, challenge)</code>. The
                fastest valid VDF proof wins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>VDFs thus elevate consensus protocols beyond simple
                Sybil resistance, introducing guaranteed temporal
                spacing, grinding resistance, and enhanced fairness
                directly into the block production mechanism.</p>

                significant problems: market inefficiency, unfairness to
                ordinary users, increased transaction fees (as bots

                <strong>decoupling transaction submission from execution
                ordering.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>How VDFs Enable Fair Ordering:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Commit-Reveal with Delay (The “TimeBoost”
                Principle):</strong> Proposed by StarkWare and others,
                this architecture leverages VDFs to create a forced
                waiting period between when users commit to transactions
                and when they are revealed and executed:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Commit Phase:</strong> Users submit
                <em>commitments</em> to their transactions –
                essentially, hashes <code>H(tx)</code> – to a mempool.
                They do <em>not</em> reveal the transaction content
                <code>tx</code> itself.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequential Delay (VDF):</strong> A VDF is
                started using the hash of the entire set of commitments
                in this phase as input:
                <code>input = H(commitment_1 || commitment_2 || ...)</code>.
                The VDF runs for delay <code>T</code> (e.g., 1-5
                minutes).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Reveal Phase:</strong> After the VDF
                output <code>y</code> is published, users must reveal
                their full transactions <code>tx</code> matching their
                earlier commitments within a short time window.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Execution:</strong> The block proposer
                orders the <em>revealed</em> transactions according to a
                simple, predetermined rule (e.g., order of commitment
                receipt, or order based on the VDF output
                <code>y</code>). Crucially, the proposer only sees the
                transaction <em>content</em> <em>after</em> the VDF
                delay has enforced a separation from the commitment
                phase.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Why This Mitigates MEV:</strong></p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Blinding the Proposer:</strong> During
                the critical period when the proposer would normally be
                analyzing transaction content to maximize MEV (e.g.,
                identifying lucrative DEX swaps), they only see opaque
                commitment hashes. They gain <em>no information</em>
                about the content or economic value of the
                transactions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Eliminating Real-Time Reaction:</strong>
                Searchers running front-running bots cannot see the
                target transactions (like large swaps) until the reveal
                phase <em>after</em> the VDF delay. By the time the
                transaction content is public, it’s too late to react
                and submit a front-run transaction within the same
                block, as the reveal window is typically short and
                ordering is predetermined. The VDF delay <code>T</code>
                acts as an enforced cooldown period.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Enforcing Ordering Fairness:</strong> The
                ordering rule (e.g., first-come-first-served by
                commitment) is applied only after the reveal, removing
                the proposer’s ability to manipulate order for profit.
                Alternatively, using the VDF output <code>y</code> as a
                seed for a random shuffle further reduces
                predictability.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Architectural Variations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>VDF-Based Sequencing:</strong> Instead of
                just blinding, the VDF output <code>y</code> can
                directly determine the ordering of transactions. For
                example, <code>y</code> could seed a random permutation
                applied to the list of revealed transactions. This makes
                the final order completely unpredictable until the VDF
                completes, further frustrating MEV extraction
                strategies. Proposals in Ethereum research explore
                this.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Threshold Decryption:</strong> Instead of
                simple commitments, transactions can be encrypted. The
                reveal phase requires decryption, potentially using a
                threshold scheme among validators. The VDF delay still
                enforces the critical blind period.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Impact on the MEV Landscape:</strong> While
                not eliminating MEV entirely (arbitrage opportunities
                across blocks or within the constraints of the ordering
                rule may persist), VDF-based commit-reveal schemes
                fundamentally disrupt the most predatory forms like
                front-running and back-running. They shift the advantage
                away from sophisticated searchers with real-time data
                feeds and low-latency infrastructure back towards
                ordinary users. This promotes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Increased Fairness:</strong> Users have a
                more level playing field.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Reduced Centralization:</strong> Less
                incentive for specialized MEV extraction
                infrastructure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lower Fees:</strong> Reduced competition
                among bots for priority gas auctions (PGAs).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Less
                frustration from “sandwich attacks” and failed
                transactions due to front-running.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Balancing the delay
                <code>T</code> (long enough to prevent real-time
                reaction) with user experience (not making transaction
                confirmation excessively slow) is key. Applications
                requiring sub-second finality might not be suitable, but
                for many DeFi interactions, a 1-5 minute delay is an
                acceptable trade-off for significantly improved
                fairness. The “TimeBoost” concept exemplifies how VDFs,
                designed initially for randomness, become crucial tools
                for market integrity in decentralized finance.</p>

                Timestamping and Proofs of Non-Exclusion</h3>
                <p>Beyond randomness and consensus, VDFs provide
                powerful mechanisms for proving the passage of time
                itself and the relationship of data to that timeline in
                a decentralized manner.</p>
                <p><strong>Decentralized Timestamping:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Proving that a specific
                piece of data (e.g., a document hash, a software
                release, an invention disclosure) existed at a certain
                point in time is crucial for intellectual property,
                audits, and legal evidence. Centralized timestamping
                services exist but require trust. Blockchain timestamps
                (writing the hash to a block) are decentralized but lack
                precision (block times are probabilistic) and can be
                expensive.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF Solution:</strong> A user wanting to
                timestamp document <code>D</code> computes
                <code>x = H(D)</code>. They then compute
                <code>(y, π) = VDF.Eval(pp, x)</code> using a widely
                recognized VDF beacon’s parameters. The pair
                <code>(x, y, π)</code> serves as a timestamp
                certificate.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verification:</strong> Anyone

                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p>Check <code>x = H(D)</code> (proves
                <code>y</code> is bound to <code>D</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p>Run <code>VDF.Verify(pp, x, y, π)</code> (proves
                <code>y</code> required significant sequential work
                after <code>x</code> was known).</p></li>
                <li><p>Confirm the VDF parameters <code>pp</code> and
                delay <code>T</code> are standardized and
                recognized.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Guarantee:</strong> This proves that the
                document <code>D</code> existed (or its hash was known)
                <em>at least</em> <code>T</code> seconds before
                <code>y</code> was published. The sequentiality of the
                VDF ensures the time elapsed is genuine.
                <strong>Comparison:</strong> This is more efficient and
                potentially more precise than blockchain-based methods
                like OpenTimestamps (which relies on Bitcoin block
                inclusion). While Bitcoin provides coarse-grained (~10
                min) decentralized time, VDFs offer finer-grained,
                cryptographically verifiable delays anchored to a
                specific computation.</li>

                systems like blockchains or content distribution
                networks (CDNs). If a user broadcasts <code>tx</code>
                but it doesn’t appear in the next block, was it
                censored? Or just delayed by the network?</p></li>

                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>The Commitment:</strong> The block
                producer (or data publisher) commits to the set of items
                <code>S</code> they intend to include (e.g., the list of
                transaction hashes for the next block) <em>before</em>
                producing the block. This commitment
                <code>C = H(S)</code> is published.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Delay &amp; Publication:</strong> The
                producer then has a fixed time window <code>T</code>
                (enforced by expectation or slashing) to compute the
                block/VDF and publish the full block data
                <code>S</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Non-Inclusion Proof:</strong> If
                <code>tx</code> is <em>not</em> in the published set

                prove its absence <em>relative to the commitment
                <code>C</code></em> using a cryptographic accumulator
                (like a Merkle tree) built from <code>S</code>. They

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Role of VDFs:</strong> The VDF comes into
                play <em>if the producer fails to publish <code>S</code>
                on time</em>. Suppose the producer commits to
                <code>C</code> but then stalls or censors. The user can
                initiate a challenge:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p>User starts a VDF computation using

                <li><p>If the user completes this VDF <em>before</em>

                significant amount of time (<code>T_chal &gt; T</code>)
                passed after the commitment <code>C</code> was made,
                <em>without</em> the producer revealing <code>S</code>.
                This strongly suggests censorship or misbehavior, as an
                honest producer should have published <code>S</code>
                well before <code>T_chal</code> elapsed.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This creates a powerful
                accountability mechanism. Block producers know that if
                they commit to a set <code>C</code> but then exclude
                committed transactions without good reason (like invalid
                signatures), they risk being challenged and slashed
                based on a VDF proof of their delay. This deters
                censorship. In CDNs, it could prove that content
                promised to be available by a certain time (committed)
                was not delivered.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>VDFs thus extend their reach beyond the core engines
                of blockchain consensus and randomness, becoming
                versatile tools for temporal certification and
                verifiable data availability. They enable decentralized
                systems to prove not just <em>what</em> happened, but
                <em>when</em> it happened, and crucially, <em>what
                didn’t</em> happen within an expected timeframe. This
                ability to verifiably constrain the flow of time and

                The Green Alternative? VDFs vs. Proof of Work</h3>
                <p>The environmental toll of Bitcoin’s Proof of Work
                (PoW) is staggering. With an annualized energy
                consumption exceeding that of nations like Belgium or
                the Philippines (~110 TWh as of 2023) and a carbon
                footprint rivaling major metropolitan areas, PoW has
                become synonymous with crypto’s sustainability crisis.
                VDFs emerged, in part, as a response to this existential
                critique, promising sequential delay <em>without</em>
                parallel waste. But how significant is the difference,
                and is “sequential work” inherently “greener”?</p>
                <p><strong>Quantifying the Divide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>PoW: Parallel Waste:</strong> Bitcoin
                miners perform ~200 exahashes per second (EH/s). Each
                hash (SHA-256 double) consumes energy. Crucially,
                <strong>99.999%+ of this computation is
                discarded</strong>—only the miner finding a nonce below
                the target creates a valid block. This is intentional
                waste to secure the network. Energy use is
                <strong>directly proportional to hash rate</strong>,
                which scales with economic incentives (block reward +
                fees). A single Bitcoin transaction’s energy footprint
                (~1,700 kWh) can power an average US household for
                months.</p></li>

                100 J = 10^11 Joules ≈ <strong>27,800 kWh</strong> per
                evaluation.</p></li>
                <li><p>Chia’s class group VDF (<code>T ≈ 10^9</code>,
                ~100 ops/sec per core) might consume ~1,000 kWh per
                proof on efficient CPUs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Orders of Magnitude Difference:</strong>
                Compare a single Ethereum block interval (12 seconds
                pre-Merge). During this time:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>PoW Ethereum (Pre-Merge):</strong>
                Consumed ~0.1 TWh annually → ~<strong>38,000 kWh per
                block</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF (e.g., for randomness
                beacon):</strong> ~<strong>28-1,000 kWh per
                output</strong> (depending on VDF
                type/hardware).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>VDF energy use per “unit of time” is <strong>1,000 to
                100,000x lower</strong> than equivalent PoW. Crucially,
                this energy powers a <em>verifiable timing/randomness
                service</em>, not a lottery with astronomical waste.</p>
                <p><strong>The Role of Efficient Hardware
                (ASICs/FPGAs):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Inevitable Optimization:</strong> Just as
                PoW spawned Bitcoin ASICs, profitable VDF applications
                (like Chia’s block rewards) will drive ASIC/FPGA
                development. RSA modular squaring ASICs (e.g.,
                envisioned by Ethereum’s VDF Alliance) could achieve
                10-100x efficiency gains over CPUs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>A Different Ecology:</strong> Unlike PoW
                ASICs (which burn energy on futile parallel hashing),
                VDF ASICs execute a <strong>deterministic, useful
                computation</strong>. They are not competing in a
                probabilistic lottery but completing a fixed task. Their
                energy draw is predictable and scales linearly with
                <code>T</code>, not with market price or competitor hash
                rate. While manufacturing ASICs has an environmental
                cost, their operational footprint is fundamentally
                constrained by the sequential nature of the
                task.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory-Hardness as a Balancer:</strong>
                Adding a memory-hard function (MHF) layer (e.g., Argon2)
                aims to reduce the ASIC advantage by making memory
                bandwidth the bottleneck, not pure logic speed. This
                keeps hardware more commoditized (using DRAM) and less
                specialized. However, it increases total energy
                consumption per VDF. The trade-off: <strong>reduced
                centralization risk at the cost of higher absolute
                energy use per VDF output.</strong> For Ethereum’s
                beacon chain VDF, estimates suggested adding MHF might
                increase energy per VDF by 2-5x but was deemed
                worthwhile for decentralization.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Is “Useful” Sequential Work Ethically
                Superior?</strong></p>
                <p>The debate hinges on defining “usefulness”:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>PoW Apologists:</strong> Argue PoW
                secures billions in value transfer (Bitcoin) and that
                its energy use is justified, comparing it to gold mining
                or traditional finance infrastructure. Some propose
                “useful PoW” (e.g., Primecoin searching prime chains),
                but adoption is minimal.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF Advocates:</strong> Counter that VDFs
                provide a <em>directly useful service</em>—verifiable
                time and unbiased randomness—that is essential for
                decentralized systems. This service cannot be obtained
                without significant sequential computation. The energy
                spent is the <em>minimum necessary</em> for the service,
                unlike PoW’s intentional parallel waste. As researcher
                Dan Boneh stated, “VDFs give you delay as a service with
                minimal energy, whereas PoW gives you security through
                massive energy burn without an intrinsic delay
                guarantee.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Nuance:</strong> VDFs are not “free.”
                Their energy use is non-trivial, especially at scale
                (e.g., thousands of VDFs per day for a busy chain).
                However, they shift the paradigm from “waste as
                security” to “efficient sequential work as service.” In
                applications like replacing PoW consensus (Chia) or
                enabling MEV mitigation, the net environmental benefit
                compared to PoW chains is profound and quantifiable.
                They represent not perfection, but a monumental leap
                towards sustainability in decentralized
                computing.</p></li>

                Incentive Structures and Tokenomics</h3>
                <p>VDFs don’t run themselves. Ensuring reliable
                evaluation in a decentralized system requires careful
                economic design to incentivize participation and punish
                misbehavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Designing Incentives for
                Evaluators/Provers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Need:</strong> Running VDF evaluation
                requires costly hardware (ASICs/FPGAs/servers) and
                electricity. Evaluators (provers) must be
                compensated.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Models:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Block Rewards &amp; Fees (Consensus
                Integrated):</strong> In Chia, the farmer who wins the
                block via PoSpace <em>and</em> completes the VDF proof
                first receives the block reward (XCH). The VDF is the
                gatekeeper to the reward. Filecoin’s leader election VDF
                winner earns the right to propose a block and collect
                fees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Service Fees (Standalone
                Beacon):</strong> Users or protocols consuming the VDF
                output (e.g., a DApp using randomness) pay fees to the
                evaluator. Requires a marketplace or protocol-level fee
                distribution.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Staking &amp; Slashing (Ensuring
                Liveness):</strong> Evaluators might stake tokens to
                participate. Failure to produce a valid VDF proof on
                time (e.g., due to downtime or malice) results in
                slashing (loss of stake). This guarantees service
                availability. Ethereum’s beacon chain design considered
                slashing for VDF operators missing deadlines.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hybrid Models:</strong> A combination,
                e.g., base reward + fees + staking/slashing, is likely
                for critical applications.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Economic Viability:</strong> Rewards must
                cover:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Depreciation:</strong> Cost of
                ASIC/FPGA/server divided by its lifespan.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Energy Cost:</strong>
                <code>(Energy per VDF Joules) * (Cost per Joule)</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Operational Costs:</strong> Bandwidth,
                maintenance, monitoring.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Risk Premium:</strong> For potential
                slashing or hardware failure.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Profitability depends on token value and competition.
                Oversupply of evaluators could drive rewards down, while
                scarcity could increase centralization pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Centralization Pressures: The ASIC
                Dilemma:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Inevitable Specialization:</strong>
                High-performance VDF evaluation favors ASICs/FPGAs.
                Their high upfront cost ($10k-$1M+) creates significant
                barriers to entry.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Centralization Risks:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Oligopoly Formation:</strong> A few large
                entities with access to capital and chip fabrication
                could dominate VDF evaluation, especially for chains
                with high rewards (like Chia in its early days). This
                undermines decentralization.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Geographic Concentration:</strong>
                Similar to PoW mining, VDF farms would locate near cheap
                electricity, potentially in regions with lax
                environmental regulations or fossil fuel
                dependence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Protocol Capture:</strong> Dominant
                evaluators could exert undue influence over protocol
                upgrades affecting VDF parameters or rewards.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory-Hard VDFs:</strong> As planned for
                Ethereum, increases the cost of ASICs by requiring large
                amounts of fast DRAM, reducing the efficiency gap
                vs. commodity hardware.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Algorithm Rotation/Agility:</strong>
                Designing protocols to allow periodic changes to the VDF
                construction (e.g., switching underlying group or adding
                MHF parameters) can “reset” the ASIC advantage, giving
                commodity hardware time to catch up. Requires complex
                governance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Progressive Decentralization:</strong>
                Start with a small set of permissioned, audited
                evaluators for critical services (like a randomness
                beacon) and gradually open participation as technology
                and tooling mature. Carries initial centralization
                risk.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Subsidized Hardware Programs:</strong>
                Protocol treasuries or foundations could fund
                development and distribution of open-source VDF hardware
                designs (FPGA bitstreams or ASIC blueprints), lowering
                entry barriers. Rarely implemented.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cost Models Across Applications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Consensus (Chia):</strong> Cost is
                amortized over block rewards. High value per VDF
                (winning a block), justifying ASIC investment. Cost per
                VDF ~$1-$10 (energy + hardware).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Randomness Beacon (Ethereum
                Vision):</strong> Cost must be covered by protocol
                inflation or user fees. Requires high reliability. Cost
                per VDF ~$10-$100 (energy + hardware + MHF overhead).
                Needs thousands of evaluations, making aggregate cost
                significant.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation / Fair Ordering:</strong>
                Cost potentially borne by transaction senders via fees.
                Lower value per VDF (not block-winning), favoring cost
                efficiency. Cost per VDF ~$0.10-$1. High throughput
                needed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Time-Lock Puzzles:</strong> Cost borne
                solely by the solver. Economic viability depends on the
                value of the locked secret. Can range from negligible to
                very high cost.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tokenomics of VDFs is a delicate balancing act:
                ensuring sufficient rewards to motivate robust,
                decentralized participation without enabling extractive
                centralization or imposing unsustainable costs on the
                network.</p>

                <p>VDFs, once embedded into a protocol’s core, become
                critical infrastructure. Changing them is akin to
                altering the gears of a running clock—fraught with risk
                and requiring careful coordination.</p>
                <p><strong>The Peril of Parameter Upgrades:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Adjusting <code>T</code> (Delay
                Time):</strong> Hardware improvements constantly shrink
                wall-clock time for fixed <code>T</code>. Maintaining a
                target delay (e.g., 100s for randomness) necessitates
                periodic <code>T</code> increases.
                <strong>Challenges:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Consensus:</strong> How is the new
                <code>T</code> determined? On-chain governance vote?

                forks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Backwards Compatibility:</strong> Old VDF
                outputs (using <code>T_old</code>) might be needed for
                historical verification. The protocol must handle both
                old and new <code>T</code> gracefully or mandate a clean
                break (hard fork).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Predictability:</strong> Frequent large
                <code>T</code> jumps disrupt applications relying on

                size (e.g., from RSA-2048 to RSA-4096) or switching

                <li><p><strong>Fork-Specific Input Derivation:</strong>
                Ensure the VDF input <code>x</code> includes a fork
                identifier (e.g., the genesis block hash or fork block
                hash). This guarantees different outputs <code>y</code>
                on different forks. Requires careful integration at the
                fork point.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parameter Forking:</strong> Deliberately
                change the VDF parameters (e.g., discriminant
                <code>-D</code>) as part of the fork. Ensures divergence
                but adds complexity. This is Chia’s likely approach if a
                contentious fork occurs.</p></li>

                Philosophical Implications: Trustless Time in
                Cyberspace</h3>
                <p>The advent of practical VDFs marks a watershed moment
                not just in cryptography, but in our digital ontology.
                For the first time, we possess a primitive to create
                <strong>objective, verifiable time intervals</strong>
                without reliance on atomic clocks, timestamping
                authorities, or the probabilistic ticks of Proof-of-Work
                blockchains. This capability carries profound
                philosophical weight.</p>
                <p><strong>The Significance of Decentralized
                Timekeeping:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Time as a Shared Anchor:</strong> Human
                societies function on shared temporal understanding
                (schedules, deadlines, history). Cyberspace, however,
                has been fragmented by local system clocks vulnerable to
                drift and manipulation. VDFs create a common, objective,
                and <em>cryptographically verifiable</em> temporal
                reference frame. As Vitalik Buterin articulated, “Time
                is the most fundamental coordination problem. VDFs give
                us a way to solve it trustlessly.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Beyond Physical Clocks:</strong> While
                NTP servers sync to atomic time, they rely on
                centralized infrastructure and offer no
                <em>cryptographic proof</em> that a specific duration
                has elapsed between two events. VDFs provide exactly
                that: proof that a minimum amount of sequential
                computation, translating to real time, occurred between
                the input commitment and the output revelation.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Transformative Implications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Digital Contracts with Enforced
                Temporality:</strong> Smart contracts can now reliably
                enforce delays without trusted oracles:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Automatic Vesting:</strong> Tokens locked
                by a VDF time-lock puzzle, releasing only after a
                provable 1-year delay.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fair Auctions:</strong> Sealed bids
                revealed only after a VDF-enforced period, preventing
                last-second sniping.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Grace Periods:</strong> Challenges to
                governance proposals or insurance claims requiring a
                VDF-proven period for evidence gathering before
                resolution.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Governance Anchored in Verifiable
                Time:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unforgeable Deadlines:</strong> Voting
                periods, proposal submission windows, or delegate terms
                can be defined by VDF computations, not subjective block
                heights or wall-clock estimates. This prevents
                manipulation via chain reorgs or fake
                timestamps.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Historical Accountability:</strong>
                Combining VDF timestamps with on-chain data creates an
                immutable, temporally ordered record. Proving an event
                occurred <em>before</em> a specific VDF output becomes
                cryptographically verifiable, crucial for audits,
                dispute resolution, or proving prior art in
                decentralized intellectual property systems.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Redefining Record-Keeping:</strong>
                VDF-based timestamping shifts the paradigm from “this
                data existed at some point” (as provided by simple block
                inclusion) to “this data existed, and <em>at least this
                much time has provably passed</em> since its
                commitment.” This creates a richer, verifiable temporal
                context for digital archives, scientific data
                provenance, and legal evidence. Projects like
                <strong>Chronicled</strong> explore this for supply
                chain documentation.</p></li>

                <p><strong>VDFs as Foundational
                Infrastructure:</strong></p>
                <p>Just as public-key cryptography (RSA, ECC) became the
                bedrock of secure communication and digital signatures,
                VDFs are poised to become a fundamental primitive for
                <strong>temporal integrity</strong>. They enable a new
                layer of trustless coordination:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Trustless Randomness:</strong> The
                bedrock of fair systems (Section 7.1).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Guaranteed Liveness:</strong> Enforcing
                minimum delays prevents rushing attacks in consensus or
                governance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Temporal Ordering:</strong> Providing a
                verifiable sequence for events where absolute time is
                less critical than relative delay.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>“Proof of Elapsed Time”:</strong> A new
                concept, distinct from PoW’s “proof of burned energy,”
                proving that a specific, unavoidable duration has passed
                in the digital realm.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The philosophical shift is profound: VDFs allow us to
                bootstrap temporal objectivity from computational
                complexity. They transform time from a subjective,
                manipulable variable into a measurable, verifiable
                resource within cyberspace. This capability underpins
                visions of a more equitable, transparent, and robust
                digital future—one where the flow of events and the
                enforcement of agreements are governed not by
                centralized authorities or probabilistic chance, but by
                the immutable laws of mathematics and sequential
                computation. The deployment of VDFs isn’t just an
                engineering feat; it’s a step towards building a digital
                temporality as reliable and foundational as the physical
                time governing our universe.</p>
                <p>[Transition to next section: While VDFs offer
                transformative potential, their journey is not without

                <p>The transformative potential of Verifiable Delay
                Functions—as engines of decentralized randomness,
                fairness, and temporal integrity—paints a compelling
                vision for the future of trustless systems. Yet, like
                any nascent technology pushing theoretical and practical
                boundaries, VDFs exist within a landscape of heated
                debates, unresolved vulnerabilities, and fundamental
                constraints. This section confronts the shadows cast by
                their promise, examining the controversies that divide
                experts, the limitations inherent to their design, and
                the open challenges that will determine their ultimate
                role in the cryptographic ecosystem. A clear-eyed
                assessment of these issues is not a repudiation of VDFs’
                value, but a necessary step towards their mature and
                secure deployment.</p>

                The Trusted Setup Debate: Achilles’ Heel or Manageable
                Risk?</h3>
                <p>The specter of the trusted setup haunts RSA-based
                VDFs (Pietrzak, Wesolowski). The catastrophic
                consequence is undeniable: knowledge of the factors
                <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> of the modulus
                <code>N</code> allows instantaneous computation of any
                VDF output, utterly bypassing the sequential delay
                <code>T</code>. This vulnerability has ignited a
                persistent debate: is this a fatal flaw relegating RSA
                VDFs to obscurity, or a manageable risk mitigated by
                advanced cryptography and process?</p>
                <p><strong>Criticisms: The “Ceremony of Doom”
                Narrative:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Inherent Centralization Risk:</strong>
                Critics argue that any trusted setup, even via
                Multi-Party Computation (MPC), reintroduces a point of
                centralized failure antithetical to decentralization
                ideals. The Ethereum Foundation’s ambitious RSA-2048 MPC
                ceremony (2019), while involving ~1,400 participants,
                exemplified the complexity. Security researcher Nadia
                Heninger quipped, “A ceremony with 1,400 participants
                isn’t trustless; it’s 1,400 single points of failure.”
                The logistical hurdles, potential for software bugs in
                custom MPC code (e.g., the adapted GG18 protocol), and
                the sheer difficulty of ensuring <em>all</em>
                participants securely deleted their shares raised valid
                concerns.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Long-Term Vulnerability:</strong> The
                generated modulus <code>N</code> is intended for
                long-term use. Advances in factoring algorithms
                (classical or quantum) or the discovery of a flaw in the
                MPC protocol could retroactively compromise security
                years later. The modulus becomes a “cryptographic time
                bomb.” As cryptographer David Wong noted, “You’re not
                just trusting the ceremony happened correctly; you’re
                trusting it will <em>remain</em> secure for decades
                against unknown attacks.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Procedural Trust vs. Cryptographic
                Trust:</strong> Even if the MPC protocol is sound,
                participants must trust the software they ran, the
                randomness of their entropy sources, and the absence of
                covert side-channel leaks during computation. This
                shifts trust from a single authority to a complex,
                opaque <em>process</em>. For purists, this procedural
                trust violates the cryptographic ideal of
                verifiability.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Defenses: Rituals as Robust
                Practice:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Distributed Trust:</strong> Proponents
                counter that large-scale MPC ceremonies
                <em>dramatically</em> raise the bar for compromise.
                Corrupting or coercing a significant fraction of
                hundreds or thousands of globally distributed
                participants is considered logistically infeasible and
                easily detectable. The 2019 Ethereum ceremony
                demonstrated that mass participation is achievable with
                rigorous tooling and community engagement.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verifiable Contributions:</strong> Modern
                MPC protocols allow participants to cryptographically
                verify that their contribution was correctly
                incorporated into the final modulus and that the output
                <code>N</code> is a valid product of two large primes
                (e.g., via zero-knowledge proofs or verifiable delay
                functions themselves!). This provides strong <em>public
                auditability</em>, not just procedural hope.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation via Redundancy:</strong>
                Architectures can be designed to use <em>multiple</em>
                independently generated moduli (from separate
                ceremonies) in parallel. Compromising one modulus
                wouldn’t break the entire system. While increasing
                complexity, this hedges against ceremony
                failure.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Transparent Alternatives: Class Groups
                and Isogenies:</strong></p>
                <p>The debate intensifies when comparing RSA VDFs to
                alternatives:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Class Groups (Chia):</strong> Offer a
                transparent setup. The discriminant <code>-D</code> is
                generated publicly from a random seed (e.g., a Bitcoin
                block hash). No secrets exist to leak.
                <strong>Critique:</strong> Class group cryptography is
                less battle-tested than RSA. While computing the class
                number <code>h(-D)</code> is believed hard, subtle
                vulnerabilities in the group structure or underlying
                problems could exist. Performance is also
                worse.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Isogeny VDFs:</strong> Setup is also
                typically transparent (public starting curve
                <code>E_0</code>). <strong>Critique:</strong> The
                immaturity of isogeny-based cryptography was starkly
                highlighted by the 2022 break of the SIKE encryption
                scheme by Castryck and Decru. While the attack targeted
                a specific isogeny construction, it underscored the
                fragility of this young field. Isogeny VDFs are also
                currently impractical.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Quest for Efficient Transparent RSA
                VDFs:</strong></p>
                <p>Is a transparent setup possible for RSA-like VDFs
                <em>without</em> class groups? Research explores using
                “universal” moduli, like the RSA numbers from the old
                RSA Factoring Challenge. However, these are few, of
                uncertain origin, and often too small for modern
                security. Generating a modulus where <em>no one</em>
                knows the factors cryptographically remains an open
                problem. Some propose using a VDF <em>during</em>
                modulus generation to enforce honest behavior, but this
                creates a circular dependency. <strong>The debate
                remains unresolved:</strong> For high-stakes,
                high-throughput applications requiring battle-tested
                cryptography, many deem well-executed MPC a manageable,
                albeit non-ideal, risk. For maximal decentralization and
                long-term quantum preparedness, class groups or
                isogenies are preferred, accepting their performance or
                maturity trade-offs. The ideal of a truly transparent,
                efficient, and post-quantum secure VDF remains an active
                research frontier.</p>

                <li><p><strong>PoW ASICs (e.g., Bitcoin):</strong>
                Achieve 100,000x+ speedup over CPUs by parallelizing the
                hash search.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF ASICs (e.g., RSA Modular
                Squaring):</strong> Achieve speedups of 10-100x by
                optimizing the <em>latency</em> and <em>energy
                efficiency</em> of a single squaring operation. For
                <code>T=10^9</code>, a 50x speedup reduces wall-clock
                time from 27 hours to ~30 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia’s Reality:</strong> Chia’s class
                group VDFs were specifically chosen partly for perceived
                ASIC resistance due to complex ideal arithmetic.
                However, specialized FPGA implementations emerged within
                months, drastically outperforming CPUs. Full ASICs are a
                logical next step. The Chia Network acknowledged this,
                stating their design aimed to make ASICs “commoditized”
                rather than eliminate them, but the centralization
                pressure remains.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Economic Drivers:</strong> Where VDF
                evaluation is tied to valuable rewards (block production
                in Chia, potential beacon rewards in Ethereum), the
                economic incentive to build faster hardware is immense.
                Capital concentrates where ROI is highest.</p></li>

                <p>Ethereum’s planned VDF-based randomness beacon
                explicitly incorporated <strong>memory-hard functions
                (MHFs)</strong> like Argon2 as a defense:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The VDF input
                <code>x</code> is first pre-processed:
                <code>x' = MHF(x)</code>. The VDF then computes
                <code>y = VDF.Eval(pp, x')</code>. The MHF computation
                requires large, fast memory (DRAM) access.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make the cost of building
                an ASIC dominated by DRAM (which is relatively
                commoditized and offers less efficiency gain over
                CPUs/GPUs) rather than custom logic. A 2019 analysis by
                the Ethereum Foundation suggested adding Argon2 could
                reduce potential ASIC speedup from ~100x to
                ~10x.</p></li>

                a few large, professional ASIC farms inherently less
                valid than one run on consumer laptops, if the protocol
                rules are followed? Different projects answer
                differently:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Chia:</strong> Accepts ASICs as
                inevitable, focusing on making the <em>space</em>
                component (Proof-of-Space) the primary Sybil-resistance
                layer, with VDF ASICs acting as a necessary sequential
                gatekeeper.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ethereum’s Stalled Vision:</strong>
                Prioritized strong ASIC resistance via MHFs, but the
                added complexity and persistent concerns contributed to
                deferring VDF integration into the beacon
                chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Pragmatic View:</strong> Acknowledges
                that some centralization in VDF evaluation might be an
                acceptable trade-off for the critical services they
                provide (unbiased randomness, MEV mitigation),
                especially if the <em>verification</em> remains
                lightweight and decentralized. The focus shifts to
                preventing <em>monopolistic</em> control through
                economic design (e.g., permissionless participation,
                competitive rewards).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The dream of VDFs as inherently ASIC-resistant
                “egalitarian” compute has largely faded. The consensus
                leans towards VDFs being <em>less susceptible to extreme
                centralization</em> than PoW, but not immune.
                Memory-hardness offers mitigation, not elimination, at a
                cost. The optimal path balances hardware reality,
                decentralization ideals, and application needs.</p>

                Uncertainty</h3>
                <p>The advent of large-scale quantum computers poses an
                existential threat to most current public-key
                cryptography, including RSA and class group-based VDFs.
                Shor’s algorithm efficiently factors integers and
                computes discrete logarithms, allowing quantum
                adversaries to instantly compute VDF outputs by
                revealing the group order (<code>φ(N)</code> or
                <code>h(-D)</code>) and breaking soundness by forging
                proofs. This casts a long shadow over the long-term
                viability of these constructions.</p>
                <p><strong>The Looming Quantum Threat:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>RSA &amp; Class Groups:</strong> Both
                rely on the hardness of problems (factoring, class group
                discrete log) fully broken by Shor’s algorithm. A
                cryptographically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC)
                instantly renders them insecure. Estimates for CRQC
                arrival vary wildly, but NIST and many experts suggest a
                non-negligible probability within 10-30 years.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Store Now, Decrypt Later” (SNDL)
                Risk:</strong> Attackers could record VDF outputs
                (<code>y</code>) and associated proofs (<code>π</code>)
                today. Once a CRQC exists, they could retroactively
                compute the input <code>x</code> from <code>y</code> (if
                <code>x</code> was not public knowledge) or forge proofs
                for alternative outputs, potentially undermining
                historical records or exposing secrets locked in
                time-lock puzzles. Long-lived systems using RSA/class

                post-quantum candidate, relying on the presumed quantum
                hardness of finding paths between supersingular elliptic
                curves. However, their path to practicality is
                fraught:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The SIKE Precedent:</strong> The
                devastating break of the SIKE (Supersingular Isogeny Key
                Encapsulation) scheme in 2022 by Castryck and Decru,
                using ingenious “glue-and-split” attacks on SIDH
                (another isogeny scheme), sent shockwaves. Although
                SI-VDF constructions differ, the attack profoundly shook
                confidence in the stability of isogeny-based
                assumptions. New constructions (like
                SQIsign/Higher-Dimensional Isogenies) are being
                explored, but their suitability for VDFs and long-term
                security are unknown.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance Abyss:</strong> As detailed
                in Section 4.4, SI-VDF evaluation and proof generation
                are orders of magnitude slower than RSA VDFs. A
                <code>T=10^9</code> VDF could take months or years on
                current hardware. Verification is also slower. Bridging
                this gap requires breakthroughs in isogeny formulas,
                proof systems, and potentially custom hardware – a
                monumental task.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Size Problem:</strong> Generating
                succinct proofs for long isogeny walks remains a major
                hurdle. While techniques like recursive composition or
                inner-product arguments help, proofs are still kilobytes
                to megabytes, not constant-sized like Wesolowski’s,

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Sequentiality from Lattices?:</strong>
                Constructions often leverage the sequential nature of
                lattice basis reduction (e.g., Lattice Reduction VDFs)
                or iterated squaring in groups based on ideal lattices.
                However, guaranteeing <em>inherent sequentiality</em> is
                challenging; unforeseen algorithmic advances could
                provide parallel speedups. Security often relies on less
                established assumptions than factoring.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Systems:</strong> Integrating
                efficient proof systems (like SNARKs) with lattice-based
                sequential computations adds complexity and potential
                overhead.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State of Play:</strong> Lattice-based
                VDFs are significantly less mature than isogeny-based
                ones. While offering potential performance benefits and
                relying on well-studied average-case hardness
                assumptions, their sequentiality guarantees are
                generally weaker and less intuitive than algebraic walks
                or repeated squaring. They represent a promising but
                highly speculative alternative.</p></li>

                Inherent Limitations: What VDFs Cannot Do</h3>
                <p>Despite their revolutionary potential, VDFs are not a
                cryptographic panacea. Understanding their fundamental
                boundaries is crucial to avoid misapplication and
                unrealistic expectations.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Vulnerability to Denial-of-Service (DoS)
                on Evaluators:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> VDFs guarantee that
                <em>if</em> an honest evaluator completes the
                computation, the output is verifiable. They offer
                <strong>no guarantee that the computation will be
                completed at all.</strong> A malicious actor could
                target the evaluator(s) with network-level DoS attacks,
                physical sabotage, or economic attacks (e.g., bribing
                them not to compute). In decentralized systems relying
                on a single VDF output (like a randomness beacon), this
                creates a single point of failure for liveness.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation vs. Solution:</strong>
                Strategies like redundancy (multiple evaluators in a
                committee), staking/slashing (penalizing downtime), or
                fallback mechanisms can <em>mitigate</em> but not
                <em>eliminate</em> this risk. The underlying
                vulnerability – the reliance on specific nodes to
                perform sequential work – remains inherent. VDFs secure
                the <em>result</em> of computation, not its
                <em>initiation</em>.</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Abstraction Gap:</strong> VDFs
                enforce a minimum amount of <em>sequential
                computation</em> (<code>T</code> steps). They do not
                guarantee a precise <em>wall-clock duration</em>. The
                actual time elapsed depends entirely on the hardware
                executing the sequential step.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implications:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Disparity:</strong> An ASIC farm
                might compute <code>T</code> steps in minutes, while a
                consumer CPU takes hours. Protocols relying on perceived
                “real time” delays (e.g., a 1-minute cooldown for MEV
                mitigation) must be designed around the <em>minimum
                expected hardware speed</em>, not an absolute clock.
                This can lead to inefficiencies (longer waits than
                necessary) or require dynamic <code>T</code>
                adjustments.</p></li>

                <code>T</code> small steps? The Castryck-Decru attack on
                SIDH demonstrates how unforeseen algebraic structures
                can break presumed sequentiality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Consequence:</strong> VDF security is
                fundamentally based on <em>conjectured hardness</em>,
                not proven lower bounds. This intrinsic uncertainty
                necessitates conservative parameter choices and ongoing
                cryptanalysis. We build clocks on foundations of sand,
                albeit very well-studied sand.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4. Input Dependence and Entropy
                Limitation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Garbage In, Garbage Out:</strong> VDFs
                add verifiable delay; they do not generate entropy. If
                the input <code>x</code> is predictable, biased, or
                controlled by an adversary, the output <code>y</code>
                will inherit these properties, regardless of the delay.
                A VDF-based randomness beacon is only as good as its
                entropy source (e.g., RANDAO). VDFs prevent
                <em>grinding</em> attacks on the output but cannot fix a
                biased input.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>No Magical Unpredictability:</strong> The
                unpredictability of <code>y</code> stems solely from the
                unpredictability of <code>x</code> and the sequential
                computation barrier. VDFs themselves do not inject new
                randomness. This limitation necessitates careful design
                of the input generation mechanism.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>5. Protocol-Level Blind Spots:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Fairness ≠ Equity:</strong> VDFs can
                enforce fair ordering rules (e.g., commit-reveal with
                delay), but they cannot prevent wealthier participants
                from dominating through superior infrastructure in other
                ways (e.g., submitting more transactions, running more
                validators). They address specific attack vectors (like
                front-running), not systemic inequalities.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Contextual Irrelevance:</strong> VDFs
                prove a delay occurred between input commitment and
                output revelation. They offer no inherent proof about
                the <em>meaning</em> or <em>correctness</em> of the
                underlying data or events. Verifying that a timestamped
                document is authentic or that a committed transaction is
                valid requires separate mechanisms.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recognizing these limitations tempers expectations
                but refines utility. VDFs are powerful tools for
                enforcing verifiable delays and preventing specific
                timing-based attacks. They are not magic bullets for
                decentralization, security, or fairness in all aspects.
                Their true value lies in being deployed where their
                unique properties – sequentiality, verifiability, and
                uniqueness – directly solve well-defined problems, while
                their limitations are carefully managed by the
                surrounding protocol design. The journey of VDFs from
                theoretical construct to robust infrastructure hinges on
                navigating these controversies and limitations with both
                ambition and humility.</p>

                this journey is far from complete. Standing at the
                frontier, researchers confront exhilarating challenges:
                fortifying VDFs against quantum annihilation,
                reimagining their fundamental architecture, distributing
                their computational burden, and integrating them into
                advanced cryptographic ecosystems. This final section
                charts the cutting-edge trajectories and speculative
                horizons where VDFs evolve from specialized tools into

                Post-Quantum Secure VDFs</h3>
                <p>The quantum threat casts the longest shadow over
                VDFs’ future. As Section 9.3 detailed, Shor’s algorithm
                shatters RSA and class group-based schemes, while
                isogeny-based VDFs (SI-VDFs)—the leading post-quantum
                (PQ) candidate—remain hampered by impractical
                performance and lingering security doubts after the SIKE
                break. Research now focuses on bridging this gap through
                algorithmic innovation and novel mathematical
                structures.</p>
                <p><strong>Optimizing the Isogeny Path:</strong></p>
                <p>The Ethereum Foundation’s SI-VDF initiative, in
                collaboration with teams like CBC Crypto and EPFL’s
                LASEC, epitomizes the drive for practical isogeny VDFs.
                Breakthroughs target three bottlenecks:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Faster Isogeny Evaluation:</strong>
                Replace CPU-bound sequential steps with parallelizable
                components. The 2023 work by De Feo, Leroux, and
                Wesolowski introduced <strong>projective
                isogenies</strong>, leveraging Montgomery curves and
                projective coordinates to reduce field operations by
                30%. Combined with optimized <strong>isogeny
                formulas</strong> for small primes (ℓ=2,3), this cuts
                per-step latency from milliseconds to
                microseconds—critical for billion-step walks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Succinct Proofs via Recursive
                Composition:</strong> To combat proof explosion,
                researchers adapt <strong>non-interractive folding
                schemes</strong> (inspired by Nova/Sangria). Instead of
                storing all intermediate curves, the prover recursively
                combines proofs for sub-walks. For a walk of length
                T=2ᴺ, the prover:</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Splits the walk into two halves: [0 to T/2] and
                [T/2 to T].</p></li>
                <li><p>Computes VDF outputs y₁, y₂ and proofs π₁, π₂ for
                each half.</p></li>
                <li><p>Generates a “folded” proof π_fold proving y₂ =
                F(y₁), where F encodes the second half-walk.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeats recursively until a single constant-size
                proof remains. Recent work by Chiesa, Manohar, and
                Spooner achieves O(log log T) proof sizes—kilobytes
                instead of gigabytes.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="3" type="1">
                <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> FPGAs now
                execute ℓ=2 isogeny steps in &lt;5μs (vs. 50μs on CPUs).
                The “SQIR” project (Supranational) prototypes ASICs for
                ℓ-isogeny arithmetic in 5nm silicon, targeting 100x
                speedups. As SQIR lead Jason Pang notes, “Isogenies are
                arithmetic-bound, not memory-bound. Custom silicon can
                unlock VDFs feasible for Ethereum-sized delays.”</li>

                <p><strong>Beyond Isogenies: Lattices and New Algebraic
                Structures:</strong></p>
                <p>While isogenies dominate PQ-VDF research,
                alternatives emerge:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Lattice-Based VDFs:</strong> Leverage the
                sequential hardness of <strong>lattice basis
                reduction</strong>. The “Lattice Reduction VDF” (Boneh,
                Bünz, Fisch; 2018) requires reducing a basis for
                dimension-<em>d</em> lattice for <em>T</em> steps.
                Verification uses a SNARK to prove reduction
                correctness. Challenges:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parallelization Risk:</strong> LLL
                reduction admits heuristic speedups (e.g., Block
                Korkine-Zolotarev), violating strict
                sequentiality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Overhead:</strong> SNARKs for
                lattice operations are complex. The “Spartan-Lattice”
                construction (Ganesh, Kondi, Lee; 2023) reduces
                verification to O(√T) but remains impractical for large
                <em>T</em>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation
                (VOLE)-Based VDFs:</strong> A radical 2023 proposal by
                Boyle, Kohl, and Scholl uses <strong>correlated
                randomness</strong> from VOLE to construct VDFs from any
                one-way function. By precomputing “trapdoors” via VOLE,
                the prover commits to a chain of values where each step
                depends sequentially on the prior. Verification is
                constant-time via polynomial checks. While promising for
                PQ security, it requires a trusted VOLE setup—a
                significant trade-off.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Group Actions and CSIDH:</strong>
                Building on <strong>Commutative Supersingular Isogeny
                Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH)</strong>, new VDFs exploit group
                actions. StarkWare’s “Action VDF” computes a sequence of
                group actions: g⁰, g¹, g², …, gᵀ. Sequentiality stems
                from the unknown group structure. Proofs adapt
                Pietrzak’s recursion. Though faster than SI-VDFs,
                CSIDH’s security is less studied than
                SIDH-variants.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The PQ-VDF Landscape:</strong> No clear
                winner exists. Isogenies lead in sequentiality
                guarantees but lag in performance. Lattices and VOLE
                offer speed but weaker proofs. As NIST’s PQC project
                enters its fourth round, VDF researchers closely monitor
                winners like <strong>CRYSTALS-Dilithium</strong> for
                sequential adaptations. Hybrid approaches—using
                classical VDFs shielded by PQ verifiable encryption—may
                bridge the transition.</p>

                Continuous VDFs and Incremental Proofs</h3>
                <p>Traditional VDFs produce an output only after a
                <em>fixed</em> delay <em>T</em>. Many applications,
                however, require <strong>continuous
                verification</strong>—proofs that time is passing
                <em>during</em> computation. Imagine a decentralized
                chess clock or a real-time randomness stream.
                “Continuous VDFs” (cVDFs) address this by generating
                proofs incrementally.</p>
                <p><strong>The Incremental Proof Paradigm:</strong></p>
                <p>Pioneered by Döttling, Garg, Malavolta, and Vasudevan
                (2020), cVDFs allow a prover to output proofs π₁, π₂, …,
                πₖ at intermediate steps t₁ &lt; t₂ &lt; … &lt; tₖ = T.
                Each πᵢ proves progress up to step tᵢ, without
                restarting the VDF. Verification of πᵢ is fast and
                independent of T.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Construction Insight:</strong> Build upon
                Pietrzak’s recursive framework. For T = 2ᴺ, the prover
                maintains a Merkle tree of intermediate states. At each
                checkpoint tᵢ = 2ʲ, they:</p></li>
                <li><p>Output the root of the Merkle tree for steps [0,

                sub-trees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Proof size per
                checkpoint is O(λ log T). Verification is O(λ)
                exponentiations. For T=2³⁰, a proof every second (tᵢ =
                i·10⁶) adds ~100 KB/day overhead—feasible for high-value
                applications.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Use Case: Real-Time Randomness:</strong>
                A cVDF beacon can emit unbiased random bits
                continuously. At each checkpoint tᵢ, it outputs
                H(y_{tᵢ}), where y_{tᵢ} is the VDF state. Liveness is
                ensured; even if the prover halts at tᵢ, users have
                fresh randomness up to that point. <strong>O(1)
                Labs</strong> prototypes this for Mina Protocol’s
                snarked randomness.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Challenges and Extensions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Prover Storage:</strong> Storing O(T)
                states for Merkle trees is infeasible for large T.
                <strong>STARK-based cVDFs</strong> (Ben-Sasson, Chiesa,
                Riabushenko; 2021) solve this by using a succinct
                computational trace. The prover generates a STARK proof
                attesting to the first tᵢ steps, reducing storage to
                O(1).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Adversarial Checkpoints:</strong>
                Malicious provers might choose checkpoints strategically
                to bias outputs. Solutions enforce fixed schedules
                (e.g., every k steps) or derive checkpoints verifiably
                from the VDF output itself.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sliding Windows:</strong> “Rolling” cVDFs
                (Goyal, Song, Srinivasan; 2022) maintain a window of the
                last W steps. Proof πᵢ certifies steps [i-W, i],
                enabling applications like decentralized
                rate-limiting.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>cVDFs transform VDFs from punctuated clocks into

                independent sub-tasks (T/4 steps each) to its children.
                Leaves compute short sequences. Crucially, the root must
                finish before children start, preserving
                depth-robustness. Proofs combine recursively. Offers

                <li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Tree-based d-VDFs
                offer better scalability (latency O(T + log n)) than

                <li><p><strong>Use Case: Decentralized Randomness
                Beacons:</strong> A t-VDF committee collectively
                evaluates the beacon, eliminating single-point DoS risk.
                Ethereum’s “Drand on Ethereum” project explores t-VDFs
                with 31 parties, leveraging Ethereum validators for MPC.

                enhancing privacy, scalability, or functionality.</p>
                <p><strong>SNARKs/STARKs for Compact VDF

                <p>While Wesolowski proofs are efficient, verifying many
                VDFs (e.g., in a blockchain) burdens light clients.
                <strong>Recursive proof composition</strong> offers a
                solution:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>VDF Proof Aggregation:</strong> Use a
                SNARK (e.g., Groth16, Plonk) to prove the correctness of
                k VDF verifications. The SNARK proof π_agg is O(1) in

                VDFs with <strong>zk-SNARKs</strong> to hide

                To deter Sybils, require users to solve a VDF
                periodically. The sequential work acts as a “proof of
                effort” bound to a unique identity. <strong>Worldcoin’s

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Anti-Coercion Delays:</strong> In voting
                protocols like <strong>OpenVote</strong>, voters submit
                encrypted ballots. To prevent coercion (where an
                attacker demands proof of vote <em>before</em> the
                deadline), a VDF delays the decryption key release.
                Coercers cannot verify votes within the coercion

                <li><p><strong>Fair Proposal Ordering:</strong> DAOs use
                VDFs to randomly order proposals in voting queues,

                toward a future where they are as fundamental to
                decentralized systems as digital signatures or hash
                functions are today. This vision encompasses:</p>
                <p><strong>Ubiquity in Web3:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Layer 0 Temporal Fabric:</strong> VDF
                beacons provide global, decentralized time and
                randomness for entire ecosystems—Ethereum, Polkadot,
                Cosmos—securing everything from rollup sequencing to
                cross-chain bridges. Projects like
                <strong>Supranational’s VDF Service</strong> aim to be
                the “NTP for Web3.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation Standard:</strong>
                Commit-reveal schemes with VDF delays become the norm
                for DEXs and lending protocols, drastically reducing
                predatory front-running. Uniswap v4 hooks may integrate
                VDF fair ordering.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sustainable Consensus Backbone:</strong>
                Chia’s Proof of Space and Time model inspires hybrids
                like <strong>Spacemesh’s PoST</strong>, where VDFs
                replace wasteful PoW in Nakamoto consensus.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Secure Supply Chains:</strong> VDF-based
                timestamps prove component assembly order or shipping
                durations without central auditors. Chronicled uses this
                for pharmaceutical tracking.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scientific Reproducibility:</strong>
                Researchers timestamp computational experiments (e.g.,
                protein folding simulations) via VDFs, proving duration
                and deterring result fabrication. The Folding@home
                project explores integrations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Democratic Tools:</strong> VDFs enable

                submissions, and public comment periods, ensuring
                fairness and resisting manipulation.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Philosophical Culmination:</strong></p>
                <p>VDFs realize Alan Turing’s vision of “uncomputable”
                functions enforced by physics—not of relativistic light
                cones, but of logical depth. They create a
                <strong>cryptographically verifiable arrow of
                time</strong> in cyberspace. As Silvio Micali reflected,
                “Time is the one resource even a god cannot compress.
                VDFs let us prove we’ve spent it.” In doing so, they
                enable:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Trustless Coordination:</strong>

                <li><p><strong>Temporal Integrity:</strong> Historical
                records gain immutable timestamps, resistant to
                retroactive manipulation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fairness by Construction:</strong>
                Unpredictable randomness and enforced delays level
                competitive fields.</p></li>

                <p><strong>Conclusion: From Puzzles to
                Pillars</strong></p>
                <p>The evolution of Verifiable Delay Functions mirrors
                cryptography’s broader quest: to build trust from
                mathematical truth. What began with Rivest’s playful
                “time capsule” puzzle has matured into a sophisticated
                primitive—one that imposes order on decentralized chaos
                by harnessing the irrevocable passage of computational
                time. Along this journey, VDFs have absorbed insights
                from complexity theory, algebraic geometry, and
                distributed systems, confronting challenges from trusted
                setups to quantum uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Today, VDFs stand at an inflection point. Deployments
                in Chia, Filecoin, and emerging L1s prove their
                practical value. Research in isogenies, continuous
                proofs, and distributed computation pushes their
                boundaries. Yet, their true significance lies deeper.
                VDFs embody a paradigm shift: time is no longer
                extracted from probabilistic consensus or centralized
                authorities but <em>generated</em> as a verifiable,
                intrinsic property of computation itself. They transform
                time from a passive backdrop into an active,
                programmable resource for building fairer, more
                resilient, and more trustworthy digital worlds.</p>
                <p>As quantum clouds gather and decentralized systems
                scale, the demand for robust, verifiable timekeeping
                will only intensify. The horizons charted
                here—post-quantum security, continuous streams,
                distributed trust—are not mere speculations but
                necessary evolutions. Whether VDFs mature into
                ubiquitous infrastructure or inspire even more profound
                constructs, their legacy is secure: they have taught us
                how to build clocks that tick to the immutable rhythm of
                computation, anchoring the ephemeral digital realm to
                the enduring certainty of sequential time.</p>

                constraints, and unforeseen complexities. Implementing
                VDFs demands confronting the brutal arithmetic of
                computational physics: the nanoseconds consumed by a
                modular reduction, the silicon realities of
                parallelization barriers, and the economic calculus of
                specialized hardware. This section shifts focus from the

                challenge: the inherently slow sequential evaluation
                (<code>Eval</code>), the often-overlooked overhead of
                generating the succinct proof (<code>π</code>), and the
                critical need for near-instantaneous verification
                (<code>Verify</code>). Each phase presents distinct
                bottlenecks.</p>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Dominant Operations:</strong> The

                (Wesolowski/Pietrzak):</strong> <strong>Modular
                squaring</strong> (or exponentiation) dominates. For
                RSA-2048, one 2048-bit modular squaring on a modern CPU
                core takes ~0.5-1 microsecond. Achieving
                <code>T = 10^9</code> thus requires ~10^9 * 1e-6 seconds
                = 1000 seconds (~16.7 minutes) of <em>continuous
                sequential computation</em> on a single high-end core.
                Class group operations in Chia (<code>chiavdf</code>)
                are far more expensive: a single 1024-bit discriminant
                class group squaring can take 50-100 microseconds per
                core, making <code>T=10^9</code> require 50,000-100,000
                seconds (14-28 hours) on CPU hardware. The operation

                (e.g., computing a 2-isogeny on a curve over a large
                prime field) might take 1-10 milliseconds on a CPU. For
                <code>T=10^6</code>, this already implies 1000-10,000
                seconds (17 minutes to 2.8 hours) – orders of magnitude
                slower than RSA for comparable <code>T</code>. The
                <code>SI-VDF</code> project achieved ~5ms per isogeny
                step on optimized CPU code; reducing this is
                paramount.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Optimizing the Inevitable:</strong> Since

                Amdahl’s law bites hard: even if 99% of a squaring op is
                parallelized, the remaining 1% sequential portion caps
                the speedup. For the chain of <code>T</code> steps, the
                <em>sequential dependency</em> renders multi-core CPUs
                or GPUs largely useless for accelerating
                <code>Eval</code> itself. A 1000-core machine cannot
                compute step <code>i+1</code> until step <code>i</code>
                finishes on one core. Specialized hardware (FPGAs/ASICs)
                accelerates the <em>step itself</em>, but cannot break
                the sequential chain.</p></li>

                <code>q</code> is a number with nearly <code>T</code>
                bits! Naively computing <code>g^q</code> would require
                <code>~log2(q) ≈ T</code> sequential operations,

                store intermediate results at strategically chosen
                checkpoints (e.g., every <code>k</code> steps, where
                <code>2^k</code> is manageable). To compute
                <code>π</code>, express <code>q</code> in binary and
                multiply the stored checkpoints corresponding to the
                binary representation’s 1 bits. This requires
                <code>O(T / k)</code> storage and
                <code>O(log q) = O(T)</code> <em>multiplications</em>
                (not sequential squarings), achievable in time
                comparable to a small multiple of the original

                (<code>L</code> and <code>μ</code>) during the squaring
                process. The computational cost per stored point is
                minimal (it’s already part of the squaring chain), but
                the storage and communication overhead grows with
                <code>T</code>. For <code>T=10^9</code>,
                <code>log2(T)≈30</code> points might be needed, each a
                2048-bit number (~60 KB total). The main overhead is the
                logarithmic number of extra exponentiations during proof
                construction, but these are cheap compared to the
                <code>T</code> squarings.</p></li>

                research challenge. Naive proofs storing kernel points
                or images are <code>O(T)</code> in size (gigabytes for
                large <code>T</code>). More advanced schemes (e.g.,
                using inner product arguments) aim for
                <code>O(log T)</code> or <code>O(1)</code> proof sizes,
                but the <em>generation</em> of these proofs often
                involves complex, computationally expensive

                <code>r</code> &lt; <code>l</code>) and one

                milliseconds on a modern CPU – effectively constant
                time, independent of <code>T</code>. This is the

                from challenges and are relatively small. For
                <code>T=10^9</code>, this might be 30 exponentiations,
                taking ~30-300 ms – still fast for most applications,
                but noticeably slower than Wesolowski for large
                <code>T</code>.</p></li>

                thousands of elliptic curve point operations and
                pairings. Benchmarks from the <code>SI-VDF</code>
                project show verification times in the <strong>seconds
                to minutes</strong> range for large <code>T</code>,
                compared to milliseconds for RSA/Class groups. While
                exponentially faster than evaluation, it remains a

                <li><p><strong>The DoS Amplification:</strong> While
                fast individually, verification can be a target for
                Denial-of-Service attacks. A single maliciously crafted
                invalid proof might take 1ms to reject, but flooding the
                network with thousands per second could overwhelm node
                resources. Lightweight pre-checks (syntax, proof size)
                are essential before full verification.</p></li>

                <p><strong>The Performance Trilemma:</strong>
                Implementers face a balancing act: <em>Sequential Eval
                Speed</em> vs. <em>Proof Generation/Size</em>
                vs. <em>Verification Speed</em>. Wesolowski RSA
                minimizes proof size and verification time but requires
                trusted setup and proof generation overhead. Pietrzak
                offers simpler proof gen but larger proofs and slower
                verification. Class Groups offer trust minimization at
                the cost of slower Eval. Isogenies promise PQ security
                but currently lose on all performance fronts. Choosing a

                Speedups were less dramatic than for RSA (e.g., 2-3x

                development costs millions of dollars and 12-24 months.
                This high barrier to entry creates centralization
                pressure. Only well-funded entities could deploy them,

                MHFs are designed so that fast computation requires
                massive amounts of high-bandwidth memory (RAM). ASIC

                doesn’t become the bottleneck itself and integrates
                cleanly with the sequential chain is complex. Protocols
                like <strong>MinRoot</strong> or layered approaches were
                researched. FPGA prototypes demonstrated feasibility but
                added complexity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia’s Reality:</strong> Chia’s class
                group VDFs proved <em>less</em> ASIC-friendly than
                expected, not due to inherent resistance, but due to the
                complexity of the NUCOMP algorithm and lack of
                immediate, massive profit incentive comparable to
                Bitcoin mining. Significant FPGA acceleration emerged,
                but widespread, cost-effective ASICs did not materialize
                at scale by late 2023, partly due to Chia’s market
                dynamics.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Arms Race Dynamics:</strong> The
                trajectory is clear: CPUs for development and low
                <code>T</code>, FPGAs for serious deployment and
                research, ASICs for maximum efficiency if the economic
                incentive justifies the investment. Memory-hardness
                layers are the primary defense against excessive
                centralization from ASICs, but they add complexity and
                their effectiveness is an ongoing research question. The
                “race” is less about sheer speed and more about
                balancing efficiency, decentralization, and
                security.</p>

                Case Study: Ethereum’s Beacon Chain RANDAO+VDF
                Vision</h3>
                <p>No project embodied the ambitious potential and
                sobering challenges of real-world VDF deployment more
                than Ethereum’s plan to integrate VDFs into its Beacon
                Chain for unbiased randomness. This case study
                illuminates the intricate interplay of cryptography,
                engineering, economics, and pragmatism.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>The Vision: Unbreakable, Unbiasable
                Randomness:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Ethereum’s Beacon
                Chain initially relied solely on RANDAO for randomness.
                Participants reveal pre-committed hashes sequentially.
                The last revealer can withhold their value, compute
                multiple future outcomes based on potential reveals, and
                choose the most beneficial one (“last-revealer bias” or
                grinding). This threatened the fairness of critical
                processes like validator selection and shard
                assignment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Solution: RANDAO + VDF:</strong> The
                elegant fix proposed by researchers like Justin Drake,
                Benedikt Bünz, and others involved post-processing the
                RANDAO output with a VDF. The RANDAO output
                <code>x</code> would be fed into a VDF set to a delay
                <code>T</code> longer than a slot time (~12 seconds).
                The VDF output <code>y</code> becomes the final
                randomness.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Even if the last
                RANDAO revealer knows <code>x</code> and tries to
                compute <code>y</code> themselves to bias the result,
                they <em>cannot</em> finish the VDF computation before
                the slot ends. By the time <code>y</code> is known
                (after <code>T</code> seconds), it’s too late to
                influence actions in that slot. The VDF acts as an
                unbiased, unpredictable mixer enforced by sequential
                computation time.</p></li>

                revealer.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Requirements:</strong>
                Recognizing the need for speed, the plan mandated
                <strong>specialized hardware (FPGAs initially,
                potentially ASICs later)</strong> for VDF evaluators

                <li><p><strong>Incentive Layer:</strong> Evaluators
                would be compensated in ETH for submitting valid VDF
                proofs, creating a marketplace for VDF
                computation.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Complexity Overload:</strong> Integrating
                a state-of-the-art VDF, requiring specialized hardware
                and a novel incentive layer, added immense complexity to
                the already ambitious Ethereum 2.0 (now Consensus Layer)
                rollout. Development resources were stretched
                thin.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The ASIC Boogeyman:</strong> Despite
                memory-hardness plans, concerns persisted that ASICs
                would eventually dominate evaluation, leading to
                centralization and potential manipulation of the
                critical randomness beacon. The long-term governance of
                upgrading <code>T</code> or parameters was
                daunting.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Performance and Cost
                Uncertainty:</strong> Precise cost models for running
                global VDFaaS at scale, especially with evolving
                hardware, were complex. Would the incentive be
                sufficient? Would it introduce new attack
                vectors?</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Shifting Priorities:</strong> As the
                Merge (transition to Proof-of-Stake) took precedence,
                resources focused on core consensus stability. The
                marginal security gain from VDFs, weighed against their
                complexity and risks, led to a difficult
                decision.</p></li>

                2022, Ethereum leadership announced the deferral of VDF

                deploy correctly at scale. The Ethereum ecosystem
                decided to prioritize simplicity and shipping the
                Merge.” The dream of VDF-based randomness on Ethereum
                remains alive but deferred, a testament to the gulf

                proving that verifiable delay can be engineered,
                optimized, and integrated, albeit with significant
                effort and careful navigation of hardware realities. The
                lessons learned in silicon and software lay the
                groundwork for VDFs to become ubiquitous
                infrastructure.</p>
                <p>[Transition to next section: Having navigated the
                practical realities of implementation—the bottlenecks
                confronted, the hardware leveraged, and the lessons
                etched by deployments like Ethereum’s ambitious vision
                and Chia’s operational reality—we arrive at the
                transformative potential. Section 7: The Engine of
                Decentralization: VDF Applications will explore how VDFs
                empower diverse use cases, from securing randomness and
                consensus to combatting MEV and enabling novel
                cryptographic protocols, fundamentally reshaping the
                landscape of trustless systems.]</p>
