# Cultural Landscape Management

## Introduction to Cultural Landscape Management

Cultural Landscape Management stands at the intersection of human creativity, environmental stewardship, and historical continuity, representing one of the most dynamic and integrative fields in contemporary heritage conservation. This discipline addresses the complex relationship between people and places across time, acknowledging that landscapes are not merely physical settings but palimpsests of human experience, cultural expression, and ecological interaction. As we embark on this exploration of cultural landscape management, we enter a realm where geography, history, anthropology, ecology, and numerous other disciplines converge to understand, protect, and sustain those places that embody the evolving relationship between humans and their environment.

The concept of cultural landscapes emerged from a growing recognition that the traditional dichotomy between natural and cultural heritage was insufficient to capture the rich tapestry of places shaped by human interaction with the natural world. Unlike natural landscapes, which are primarily the product of environmental processes, cultural landscapes bear the imprint of human intention, action, and meaning. They are the tangible result of countless generations living, working, and expressing their values through the modification of their surroundings. From the terraced rice fields of Bali's subak system to the formal gardens of Versailles, from the ancient agricultural landscapes of the Andes to the industrial landscapes of England's Ironbridge Gorge, these places tell stories of human ingenuity, adaptation, and cultural expression. Cultural landscape management, therefore, encompasses the theory and practice of identifying, understanding, protecting, and sustainably managing these landscapes, balancing the preservation of their heritage values with the needs of contemporary communities and ecosystems.

The scope of cultural landscape management is remarkably broad, encompassing activities ranging from inventory and documentation to physical conservation, interpretation, community engagement, and policy development. Management approaches must consider multiple dimensions of these landscapes, including their physical characteristics, historical development, cultural significance, ecological systems, and social dynamics. This comprehensive scope recognizes that cultural landscapes are not static entities but dynamic systems that continue to evolve, requiring management approaches that are both respectful of their heritage values and responsive to changing conditions and needs. The field has evolved significantly since its formal recognition in the early 1990s, expanding from a focus primarily on designed landscapes and scenic areas to include a much broader spectrum of human-modified environments, including agricultural landscapes, industrial heritage sites, sacred sites, and urban landscapes.

The importance and relevance of cultural landscape management extend far beyond the boundaries of heritage conservation. These landscapes serve as repositories of cultural memory, traditional knowledge, and historical experience, providing tangible connections to past generations and ways of life. They embody the values, beliefs, and aspirations of the communities that created and continue to inhabit them, serving as foundations for cultural identity and continuity. The Ifugao Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, for instance, represent not only an remarkable agricultural engineering achievement but also the core of Ifugao cultural identity, embodying sophisticated water management systems, social organization, and spiritual beliefs that have sustained communities for over two millennia. Similarly, the cultural landscapes of the Mediterranean region, with their ancient olive groves and vineyards, reflect millennia of agricultural adaptation and represent the cornerstone of regional identity and economy.

The aesthetic values of cultural landscapes have long been recognized, inspiring artists, writers, and travelers throughout history. The picturesque landscapes of England's Lake District, which fueled the Romantic movement in poetry and painting, continue to draw millions of visitors who seek beauty, inspiration, and connection with nature shaped by human presence. Beyond aesthetics, these landscapes possess profound ecological significance, often harboring high levels of biodiversity resulting from centuries of sustainable management practices. The dehesas of Spain and Portugal, for instance, are agro-silvo-pastoral systems that support remarkable biodiversity while providing sustainable livelihoods, demonstrating how human-modified landscapes can enhance rather than diminish ecological values.

Cultural landscapes play a crucial role in place attachment and identity formation, providing communities with a sense of belonging and continuity. Research in environmental psychology has demonstrated that people develop strong emotional connections to places that hold personal and collective meaning, contributing to individual well-being and social cohesion. The Japanese concept of "furusato," which refers to one's native place or homeland, exemplifies this deep connection between people and their cultural landscapes, evoking feelings of nostalgia, identity, and responsibility. This attachment is not limited to rural or traditional landscapes; urban cultural landscapes, from the historic quarters of cities like Venice and Kyoto to the distinctive neighborhoods of modern metropolises, similarly shape community identity and social interaction.

The educational and scientific importance of cultural landscapes cannot be overstated. These landscapes serve as outdoor classrooms and living laboratories, offering insights into historical land use practices, ecological relationships, technological innovations, and cultural values. The traditional agricultural landscapes of the Andes, for example, have provided scientists with valuable knowledge about climate-resilient farming practices, soil conservation techniques, and biodiversity management developed over centuries of experimentation and adaptation. Similarly, the ancient water management systems of places like Sri Lanka's Tank Cascade System or Iran's qanats demonstrate sophisticated engineering solutions developed long before modern technological advances, offering lessons in sustainable resource management that remain relevant today.

Economically, cultural landscapes contribute significantly to local, regional, and national economies through tourism, agriculture, and other activities. The wine-growing landscapes of regions like Bordeaux, Napa Valley, and the Douro Valley not only produce valuable agricultural products but also attract millions of visitors who contribute to local economies through tourism. The challenge for cultural landscape management is to balance these economic benefits with the conservation of heritage values, ensuring that development and tourism activities do not undermine the very qualities that make these landscapes significant. Successful examples of this balance can be found in places like the Loire Valley in France, where wine production, tourism, and heritage conservation are integrated into a mutually reinforcing system that supports both economic vitality and cultural continuity.

Several key principles guide the practice of cultural landscape management, reflecting the field's commitment to ethical, sustainable, and inclusive approaches. At the heart of these principles is the concept of stewardship, which emphasizes intergenerational responsibility and the ethical obligation to protect cultural landscapes for future generations while respecting the rights and needs of present communities. The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) philosophy of the Seventh Generation, which considers the impacts of decisions on seven generations into the future, exemplifies this long-term perspective that is increasingly recognized as essential in cultural landscape management.

Respect for cultural diversity and multiple values stands as another foundational principle, acknowledging that different communities and stakeholders may ascribe varied meanings and significance to the same landscape. This principle calls for inclusive approaches that recognize and respect diverse perspectives, particularly those of indigenous and local communities who often have the deepest connections to these landscapes. The management of Australia's Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which is jointly managed by traditional Anangu owners and government agencies, demonstrates how traditional knowledge systems and contemporary management practices can be integrated to respect cultural values while ensuring conservation and visitor access.

Sustainability and long-term thinking are central to cultural landscape management, recognizing that these landscapes have evolved over centuries and will continue to change in the future. This principle emphasizes the need for management approaches that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially equitable, ensuring the continued vitality of cultural landscapes rather than their preservation as static artifacts. The rice-fish farming systems of China's Zhejiang Province, recognized as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System, exemplify this sustainable approach, having maintained productivity and biodiversity for over 1,200 years through careful management of ecological relationships.

The balance between preservation and change represents perhaps the most challenging principle in cultural landscape management. Unlike monuments or buildings, which can often be preserved in a relatively fixed state, cultural landscapes are dynamic systems that naturally evolve over time. Management must therefore determine which elements and characteristics are essential to maintain and which can change or adapt, allowing landscapes to continue living and evolving while protecting their heritage values. The English Lake District, a working landscape of farms, villages, and natural features, illustrates this balance, where traditional farming practices are supported to maintain landscape character while allowing for necessary adaptations to changing agricultural and economic conditions.

The interdisciplinary nature of cultural landscape management is one of its defining characteristics, reflecting the complexity of the landscapes themselves. No single discipline possesses all the knowledge and tools needed to understand and manage these multifaceted systems effectively. Instead, cultural landscape management draws upon a diverse array of fields, including geography, history, anthropology, archaeology, ecology, architecture, planning, landscape architecture, heritage conservation, and tourism studies, among others. This interdisciplinary approach is essential for addressing the multiple dimensions of cultural landscapes and developing comprehensive management strategies.

The interaction between different fields of knowledge in cultural landscape management creates both challenges and opportunities. Disciplines may have different theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and professional languages, making communication and collaboration difficult at times. However, these differences also bring valuable perspectives that enrich understanding and lead to more innovative and effective management solutions. The management of the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape in Mongolia, for instance, requires the integration of archaeological knowledge about ancient nomadic settlements, ecological understanding of steppe ecosystems, anthropological insights into contemporary nomadic practices, and planning expertise to address development pressures.

The integration of scientific, cultural, and traditional knowledge represents a particularly important aspect of interdisciplinary work in cultural landscape management. Scientific approaches provide valuable tools for documentation, analysis, and monitoring, while cultural and traditional knowledge systems offer insights into the meanings, values, and historical practices associated with landscapes. The fire management practices of Aboriginal Australians, for example, developed over tens of thousands of years, are increasingly recognized for their ecological sophistication and are being integrated with contemporary fire management approaches to maintain landscape health and reduce wildfire risks.

Collaborative approaches are essential in cultural landscape management, bringing together diverse stakeholders including local communities, indigenous groups, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, scientists, and heritage professionals. These collaborations recognize that multiple stakeholders have legitimate interests and expertise related to cultural landscapes and that effective management requires their participation and cooperation. The landscape partnership approach used in the United Kingdom, for instance, brings together local communities, landowners, government agencies, and conservation organizations to develop and implement integrated management strategies for landscapes like the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The global significance of cultural landscapes has increasingly been recognized in international heritage conservation frameworks, reflecting their universal value as expressions of human creativity and adaptation. The 1992 adoption of cultural landscapes as a category of World Heritage by UNESCO marked a pivotal moment in this recognition, acknowledging that the interaction between people and their environment is a fundamental aspect of human heritage. Since then, numerous cultural landscapes have been inscribed on the World Heritage List, from the ancient agricultural terraces of the Philippines to the industrial heritage sites of Europe, representing the diversity of human interaction with the environment across time and space.

International efforts to protect and manage cultural landscapes have expanded significantly since the 1990s, with the development of guidance documents, training programs, and networks dedicated to this field. Organizations such as ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) and IFLA (International Federation of Landscape Architects) have developed specialized committees and publications focused on cultural landscapes, while regional organizations like the European Landscape Convention have promoted landscape protection and management across national boundaries. These international efforts have facilitated the exchange of knowledge and experience, helping to build capacity for cultural landscape management worldwide.

The universal value of diverse cultural landscape traditions lies in their demonstration of the many ways humans have adapted to and shaped their environments. From the desert oases of the Maghreb to the Arctic landscapes of northern Scandinavia, from the high-altitude agricultural systems of the Himalayas to the coastal fisheries communities of Southeast Asia, cultural landscapes showcase the remarkable diversity of human responses to environmental challenges and opportunities. This diversity represents an invaluable repository of knowledge, techniques, and values that can inform contemporary approaches to sustainable development and environmental management.

Cultural landscapes contribute to global diversity not only through their physical characteristics but also through the intangible cultural practices, knowledge systems, and values they embody and sustain. The biocultural diversity represented by many cultural landscapes—the intricate relationship between biological diversity and cultural diversity—is increasingly recognized as essential for both conservation and sustainable development. The coffee landscapes of Ethiopia, the birthplace of Arabica coffee, exemplify this relationship, harboring tremendous genetic diversity of coffee varieties while maintaining traditional farming practices that are integral to local cultural identity.

In addressing global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, sustainable development, and cultural preservation, cultural landscapes offer valuable insights and approaches. Many traditional landscape management practices demonstrate sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships and sustainable resource use that remains relevant today. The qanat systems of Iran and Afghanistan, ancient underground water channels that tap into groundwater aquifers and distribute water through gravity flow, represent sustainable water management techniques that could inform responses to water scarcity in many regions. Similarly, the complex agroforestry systems found in many traditional cultural landscapes demonstrate approaches to agriculture that maintain biodiversity, enhance soil fertility, and provide resilience to climate variability.

As we conclude this introduction to cultural landscape management, we recognize that this field stands at a critical juncture. The growing recognition of the importance of cultural landscapes, coupled with increasing pressures from globalization, urbanization, climate change, and other forces, makes effective management more essential than ever. The following sections will explore the historical development of this field, its theoretical foundations, the diverse types of cultural landscapes found around the world, and the methods used to assess and document them. Through this exploration, we will gain a deeper understanding of how cultural landscape management can contribute to preserving our shared heritage while supporting sustainable futures for communities and ecosystems worldwide.

## Historical Development of Cultural Landscape Management

As we turn our attention to the historical development of cultural landscape management, we recognize that this field did not emerge in a vacuum but rather evolved from a complex interplay of intellectual movements, conservation efforts, and changing societal perceptions of the relationship between people and their environments. The journey toward recognizing cultural landscapes as significant heritage worthy of protection and management reflects broader shifts in how humanity has understood its place in the natural world and the value of its historical interactions with the environment. This historical trajectory reveals how early conservation efforts focused primarily on natural wonders or monumental architecture gradually expanded to encompass the more subtle and complex landscapes shaped by human activity over time.

The origins of cultural landscape management can be traced to the broader conservation movements of the 19th century, when industrialization and urbanization began to transform landscapes at an unprecedented pace. In the United States, the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 marked a pivotal moment in conservation history, creating the world's first national park specifically set aside for public enjoyment and protection. While Yellowstone was primarily valued for its natural wonders and geothermal features, this early conservation effort reflected growing concerns about preserving landscapes from uncontrolled development. Similarly, the creation of Yosemite National Park in 1890, though initially focused on protecting natural scenery, also recognized the cultural significance of the landscape to indigenous peoples, even if this recognition was limited and often problematic by contemporary standards. Across the Atlantic, Europe's conservation movements took different forms, often emphasizing the protection of cultural landscapes alongside natural areas. In England, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, founded in 1895, explicitly recognized the importance of protecting both natural and cultural landscapes, acquiring properties that included historic houses, gardens, and broader landscape features. The Trust's early acquisitions, such as Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire and Lake District properties, demonstrated an understanding that landscape value encompassed both natural beauty and cultural significance.

The distinction between natural and cultural heritage in these early conservation efforts was often blurred, reflecting philosophical perspectives that viewed humans as separate from nature. American conservationists like John Muir, while instrumental in protecting wild landscapes, often portrayed nature as pristine and separate from human influence, a perspective that would later be challenged as cultural landscape thinking evolved. In contrast, European conservation movements, particularly in Britain, more readily acknowledged the human influence on landscapes considered beautiful or valuable. The English Romantic movement, with poets like William Wordsworth and painters like J.M.W. Turner, celebrated the Lake District not as wilderness but as a landscape shaped by both natural forces and human agricultural activity. This romantic appreciation of landscapes influenced early conservation thinking, establishing aesthetic value as a key criterion for landscape protection. The concept of the "picturesque" developed in the late 18th century by figures like William Gilpin and Uvedale Price provided a framework for appreciating landscapes that combined natural features with human elements, particularly traditional agricultural practices and vernacular architecture. This aesthetic appreciation would later evolve into a more comprehensive understanding of cultural landscape values.

Early efforts to protect designed landscapes, particularly historic gardens, represent another important precursor to cultural landscape management. The restoration of André Le Nôtre's gardens at Vaux-le-Vicomte in France began in the late 19th century, reflecting growing appreciation for these designed landscapes as cultural heritage. Similarly, in England, the creation of the National Gardens Scheme in 1927, while primarily focused on opening private gardens to raise funds for charity, reflected increasing public interest in garden history and design. These early preservation efforts for designed landscapes established important principles about documenting historical form, understanding design intent, and addressing the challenges of maintaining living landscapes that would later inform broader cultural landscape management approaches. The distinction between "natural" and "cultural" landscapes remained somewhat fluid in these early conservation movements, with protection often motivated by aesthetic considerations regardless of the degree of human influence. This fluidity would gradually give way to more nuanced understandings as the concept of cultural landscapes evolved throughout the 20th century.

The evolution of the cultural landscape concept gained momentum in the early 20th century through the work of geographers, anthropologists, and other scholars who began to systematically study the relationship between human cultures and their environments. The German geographer Otto Schlüter, writing in the early 1900s, distinguished between the "original landscape" (Urlandschaft) shaped primarily by natural forces and the "cultural landscape" (Kulturlandschaft) modified by human activity. This distinction, though somewhat simplistic by later standards, represented an important step toward conceptualizing landscapes as products of both natural and cultural processes. Schlüter's work influenced subsequent generations of geographers who would further develop the cultural landscape concept. In the United States, Carl Sauer emerged as perhaps the most influential figure in establishing cultural landscape studies as a distinct field of inquiry. Sauer, who founded the Berkeley School of cultural geography at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1920s, approached landscapes as the tangible expression of cultures, arguing that "the cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group." His 1925 monograph "The Morphology of Landscape" laid the theoretical groundwork for understanding landscapes as historical documents that could be "read" to reveal the story of human-environment interaction over time. Sauer's holistic, interdisciplinary approach combined geography, anthropology, history, and ecology to study how different cultures shaped their environments, establishing a methodology that would influence cultural landscape studies for decades to come.

The mid-20th century saw further development of cultural landscape thinking across various disciplines. In France, the geographer Pierre Deffontaines expanded on earlier concepts in his 1948 work "Géographie et Religions," exploring how religious beliefs and practices shaped landscapes around the world. The British geographer W.G. Hoskins, through his influential 1955 book "The Making of the English Landscape," demonstrated how historical analysis could reveal layers of human influence in seemingly natural landscapes, popularizing the idea that even rural landscapes were cultural artifacts with deep historical roots. Hoskins' work had a profound impact on public understanding of landscape history in Britain and helped establish landscape study as a legitimate academic pursuit. Meanwhile, in the United States, the anthropologist Julian Steward developed the concept of cultural ecology in the 1950s, examining how cultures adapt to and modify their environments, providing another important theoretical framework for understanding cultural landscapes. These diverse scholarly contributions gradually built a more sophisticated understanding of cultural landscapes as complex, historically layered phenomena that could not be adequately understood through purely natural or purely cultural frameworks alone.

The post-World War II period witnessed significant developments in heritage conservation that would eventually lead to the formal recognition of cultural landscapes. The founding of UNESCO in 1945 and subsequent international heritage conservation efforts reflected growing global awareness of the need to protect cultural heritage threatened by war, development, and neglect. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict extended protection beyond monuments and sites to include "centers containing a large amount of cultural property," implicitly recognizing the importance of broader landscape contexts. However, it was the 1964 International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites (the Venice Charter) that more explicitly addressed the relationship between monuments and their settings, stating that "the concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization." This statement represented a significant shift toward recognizing the importance of context in heritage conservation, laying groundwork for later cultural landscape approaches. The Venice Charter's influence extended globally, shaping national conservation policies and practices throughout the following decades.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention marked another milestone in the evolution toward cultural landscape recognition. Although the Convention initially focused on individual monuments and natural areas with "outstanding universal value," its definition of cultural heritage as "monuments, groups of buildings, and sites" created a framework that could later accommodate cultural landscapes. The inclusion of "sites" as a category of cultural heritage proved particularly important, as this term could be interpreted broadly to include landscapes rather than just discrete archaeological or historical sites. During the 1970s and 1980s, several properties inscribed on the World Heritage List reflected landscape values even if not explicitly identified as cultural landscapes. The 1978 inscription of the Galápagos Islands as a mixed natural and cultural property, for instance, recognized both the islands' ecological significance and their role in shaping Charles Darwin's thinking. Similarly, the 1979 inscription of the Aztec ruins of Teotihuacan in Mexico implicitly acknowledged the broader landscape context of these monumental remains. These early inscriptions demonstrated a growing appreciation for landscape values within the World Heritage framework, even before the formal establishment of cultural landscapes as a distinct category.

The 1980s represented a transitional period in which the conceptual foundations for cultural landscape management were firmly established, even if formal recognition was still evolving. During this decade, several important publications and conferences advanced cultural landscape thinking. The 1980 ICOMOS General Assembly in Sofia, Bulgaria, included discussions on the conservation of historic towns and urban areas, reflecting growing interest in broader contexts beyond individual monuments. The 1982 ICOMOS-IFLA International Charter for Historic Gardens (the Florence Charter) explicitly recognized historic gardens as living monuments requiring specific conservation approaches, acknowledging their dynamic nature and the challenges of maintaining designed landscapes over time. The Florence Charter's emphasis on continuity, authenticity, and the relationship between gardens and their broader settings provided important principles that would later inform cultural landscape management more broadly. Meanwhile, in academic circles, scholars continued to develop theoretical frameworks for understanding cultural landscapes. The American geographer Peirce Lewis, in his influential 1979 article "Axioms for Reading the Landscape," proposed that landscape was "our unwitting autobiography," reflecting cultural values and histories even when not intentionally designed to do so. This perspective helped expand understanding of cultural landscapes beyond formally designed spaces to include everyday landscapes shaped by ordinary human activities.

The formal recognition of cultural landscapes within international heritage conservation came in 1992, when the World Heritage Committee adopted cultural landscapes as a new category of World Heritage sites. This milestone resulted from several years of preparation, including expert meetings and studies that demonstrated the need for a more explicit framework for recognizing and protecting landscapes that exemplified human interaction with the environment. The 1992 World Heritage Operational Guidelines established three categories of cultural landscapes: designed landscapes created intentionally by humans; organically evolved landscapes resulting from social, economic, administrative, and/or religious imperatives, which could be further divided into relict (or fossil) landscapes and continuing landscapes; and associative cultural landscapes valued for religious, artistic, or cultural associations with natural elements rather than material cultural evidence. This categorization provided a comprehensive framework for understanding different types of cultural landscapes and their significance, reflecting the diversity of human-environment interactions around the world. The first cultural landscapes inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1993 included Tongariro National Park in New Zealand, valued for its cultural associations with the Māori people, and the Wachau Cultural Landscape in Austria, representing a continuing organically evolved landscape. These early inscriptions demonstrated the application of the new cultural landscape category and set precedents for future nominations.

The evolution of the cultural landscape concept was significantly shaped by key figures and pioneers across various disciplines and traditions. Carl Sauer stands as perhaps the most foundational figure in cultural landscape studies, establishing the Berkeley School of cultural geography and developing methodologies for studying landscapes as expressions of culture. Sauer's holistic approach combined field observation, historical research, and interdisciplinary analysis to understand how different cultures shaped their environments. His students and colleagues, including Fred Kniffen, who studied vernacular architecture and folk housing in North America, and Robert West, who examined tropical cultural landscapes, extended his influence across generations of geographers. Sauer's emphasis on the material aspects of culture as expressed in landscapes provided a counterpoint to more theoretical approaches in geography and helped establish landscape study as a legitimate academic pursuit.

Another pivotal figure in the development of cultural landscape thinking was John Brinckerhoff (J.B.) Jackson, whose work bridged academic geography and broader cultural discourse. Jackson founded the magazine "Landscape" in 1951, which became an important forum for exploring the meaning and significance of everyday landscapes. His essays, collected in books such as "Landscapes" (1970) and "Discovering the Vernacular Landscape" (1984), challenged traditional distinctions between high culture and popular culture, examining the landscapes of highways, strip malls, mobile homes, and other ordinary places with the same serious attention previously reserved for grand monuments or picturesque scenery. Jackson's concept of the "vernacular landscape"—landscapes shaped by ordinary people going about their daily lives rather than by designers or planners—expanded understanding of cultural landscapes beyond formally designed spaces. His accessible writing style and interdisciplinary approach influenced not only academics but also planners, designers, and preservationists, helping to popularize landscape studies and broaden appreciation for diverse types of cultural landscapes.

The field of landscape architecture also contributed important voices to the development of cultural landscape thinking. The American landscape architect Ian McHarg, through his influential 1969 book "Design with Nature," advocated for ecological approaches to landscape planning that respected natural processes while accommodating human needs. McHarg's emphasis on understanding the natural and cultural layers of landscapes before making design decisions reflected a holistic approach that aligned with emerging cultural landscape perspectives. Meanwhile, in Britain, the landscape architect Sylvia Crowe helped bridge the gap between historic garden conservation and broader landscape management through her work with organizations like the National Trust and her writings on landscape design and conservation. Her 1958 book "Garden Design" and later works like "The Landscape of Power" (1958) and "The Landscape of Roads" (1960) demonstrated how landscape architecture could engage with both historical continuity and contemporary change in landscapes.

Indigenous and traditional knowledge holders played a crucial but often overlooked role in shaping cultural landscape thinking, offering perspectives that challenged Western distinctions between nature and culture. In Australia, Aboriginal elders and knowledge holders maintained sophisticated understandings of Country that encompassed spiritual, cultural, and ecological dimensions of landscapes, perspectives that gradually influenced mainstream conservation approaches. The 1985 handback of Uluru (Ayers Rock) to its traditional Anangu owners marked a significant moment in recognizing indigenous landscape relationships, though full recognition of indigenous cultural landscape management approaches would take longer to develop. Similarly, in North America, Native American leaders and scholars like Vine Deloria Jr. challenged conventional conservation paradigms through writings that emphasized indigenous relationships with land as holistic and sacred rather than merely utilitarian or aesthetic. These indigenous perspectives, though long marginalized in formal conservation discourse, provided important alternatives to Western approaches to landscape management that increasingly influenced the field as cultural landscape thinking evolved.

The development of cultural landscape management was significantly advanced through international agreements and conventions that established frameworks for recognition, protection, and management. The 1992 adoption of cultural landscapes as a World Heritage category represented the most significant international recognition of these landscapes as heritage, but it was preceded and followed by other important instruments and initiatives. The 1994 Nara Document on Authenticity, though not specifically focused on cultural landscapes, provided crucial guidance on understanding authenticity in heritage contexts, particularly important for cultural landscapes that are inherently dynamic and evolving. The Nara Document recognized that authenticity must be judged within the cultural contexts that created heritage, challenging Eurocentric notions of authenticity based primarily on material form and opening the door to more culturally diverse approaches to heritage conservation, including cultural landscapes.

The 1990s saw the development of several important charters and guidelines specifically addressing cultural landscape management. The 1994 ICOMOS-IFLA International Charter for Cultural Landscapes, developed at a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, and later formally adopted as the ICOMOS Charter for Cultural Landscapes, provided comprehensive guidance on the identification, conservation, and management of cultural landscapes. This charter emphasized the importance of understanding landscape values through interdisciplinary research, recognizing the dynamic nature of cultural landscapes, and involving local communities in management processes. It also addressed the practical challenges of managing living landscapes that continue to evolve while maintaining their heritage values. The charter's principles reflected the accumulated experience of cultural landscape practitioners worldwide and established a framework that would guide management approaches in the following decades.

Regional landscape conventions also played important roles in advancing cultural landscape management. The 2000 European Landscape Convention, also known as the Florence Convention, represented a groundbreaking approach to landscape protection and management by covering all landscapes, not just those of exceptional heritage value. The Convention defined landscape broadly as "an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors," explicitly acknowledging that landscapes result from both natural processes and human activities. This inclusive approach recognized that ordinary everyday landscapes, not just exceptional heritage sites, deserve attention in planning and management

## Theoretical Foundations and Concepts

The European Landscape Convention of 2000 represented not merely a legal instrument but a conceptual watershed in how societies understand and engage with landscapes. By recognizing all landscapes, not just those of exceptional heritage value, as legitimate subjects of attention, the Convention reflected a deeper theoretical shift in landscape thinking that had been developing across multiple disciplines for decades. This shift toward understanding landscape as fundamentally cultural in nature—shaped by human perception, interpretation, and meaning-making as much as by physical processes—provides the foundation for exploring the theoretical underpinnings of cultural landscape management. Theories and concepts from geography, anthropology, psychology, heritage studies, and numerous other fields have converged to create a rich intellectual framework for understanding how cultural landscapes function, how they are valued, and how they might be responsibly managed. These theoretical foundations are not merely academic constructs but practical tools that inform how we identify, document, interpret, and make decisions about cultural landscapes around the world.

The concept of landscape as cultural construct challenges traditional notions of landscape as primarily a physical or visual phenomenon. Instead, it posits that landscape is fundamentally a way of seeing— a cultural product that reflects particular ways of understanding and organizing the world. This perspective, developed through the work of cultural geographers, art historians, and cultural theorists, emphasizes that what we recognize as "landscape" is never simply the physical reality of a place but rather that reality filtered through cultural lenses, shaped by values, beliefs, experiences, and power relationships. The cultural geographer Denis Cosgrove, in his seminal work "Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape" (1984), argued that landscape is not an empirical object but a concept, a way of seeing that emerged in Renaissance Europe and became naturalized as a universal way of experiencing the world. This critical perspective reveals how landscape representations, from paintings to photographs to maps, actively shape how we understand and value places, often reflecting and reinforcing particular cultural values and power structures.

The relationship between physical reality and cultural perception becomes particularly evident when examining how different cultures conceptualize and value the same geographical space. What appears as a "wilderness" to Western eyes might be understood as a culturally rich homeland by indigenous inhabitants. The Australian landscape, for instance, was initially described by British colonists as "empty" and "untamed," reflecting European cultural frameworks that failed to recognize the complex management systems and cultural meanings embedded in the land by Aboriginal peoples over tens of thousands of years. Conversely, Aboriginal concepts of Country encompass spiritual, ecological, cultural, and social dimensions that Western notions of landscape often separate, reflecting fundamentally different ways of understanding human relationships with the environment. These differing cultural constructions of landscape have profound implications for management approaches, as what constitutes appropriate care, use, and preservation depends heavily on how landscape is conceptualized.

Language itself plays a crucial role in constructing landscape, as vocabulary reflects and reinforces particular ways of seeing and understanding. The English language, for example, contains numerous terms for different types of terrain and vegetation that reflect historical land use practices and aesthetic values, while potentially lacking words for landscape features and relationships that other cultures find significant. The Inuit peoples of the Arctic have developed a rich vocabulary for describing different types of snow and ice conditions, reflecting deep knowledge of environmental nuances essential for survival and cultural practice. Similarly, many indigenous languages contain terms that express relationships between people and places that have no direct equivalent in English, such as concepts that simultaneously describe physical features, ancestral connections, and spiritual significance. These linguistic differences reveal how fundamentally language shapes our perception and experience of landscape, with important consequences for how cultural landscapes are documented, interpreted, and managed.

Artistic and literary traditions have played particularly powerful roles in constructing cultural landscapes, establishing aesthetic preferences and symbolic associations that persist long after their creation. The Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with its celebration of mountains, wilderness, and ruins, fundamentally transformed Western perceptions of landscape, elevating certain types of scenes to the status of culturally significant landscapes. The paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, J.M.W. Turner, and the writers like William Wordsworth and Lord Byron not only reflected changing attitudes toward landscape but actively shaped them, establishing the Alps, the English Lake District, and other Romantic landscapes as places of cultural value. These artistic traditions continue to influence landscape preferences and conservation priorities today, as seen in the protection of scenic areas that conform to Romantic aesthetic ideals. Similarly, Chinese landscape painting traditions, dating back to the Tang Dynasty, developed sophisticated symbolic systems that expressed philosophical and spiritual relationships with the natural world, influencing garden design and landscape management practices throughout East Asia.

Contemporary theoretical approaches to landscape as cultural construct have expanded to include critical perspectives that examine how landscape representations and experiences are shaped by power relations, colonialism, gender, and other social dynamics. Feminist geographers, for instance, have explored how gender influences landscape experience and representation, challenging the notion of a universal "view from nowhere" in landscape appreciation. Postcolonial theorists have examined how colonial powers reinterpreted indigenous landscapes through European cultural frameworks, often erasing existing management systems and cultural meanings in the process. These critical perspectives enrich our understanding of cultural landscapes by revealing the multiple, sometimes conflicting ways that different groups experience and value the same geographical space, highlighting the importance of inclusive approaches to cultural landscape management that acknowledge diverse perspectives and experiences.

This understanding of landscape as cultural construct naturally leads us to consider the emotional and psychological connections people form with places, explored through the concepts of place attachment and sense of place. These concepts, developed primarily in environmental psychology but drawing on insights from geography, sociology, and anthropology, examine the affective bonds between people and places that transcend utilitarian relationships. Place attachment refers to the emotional connections that individuals and groups develop with specific places, while sense of place encompasses the meanings, symbols, and qualities that make a place distinctive and significant. These concepts help explain why certain landscapes matter deeply to people, serving as foundations for identity, community, and well-being. The environmental psychologist Edward Relph, in his pioneering work "Place and Placelessness" (1976), described sense of place as "the direct experience of the meaning and identity of places," emphasizing that this experience involves both cognitive understanding and emotional response.

Place attachment develops through multiple pathways, including personal experiences, social relationships, cultural traditions, and historical connections. Childhood experiences in particular landscapes often establish deep emotional bonds that persist throughout life, as seen in the powerful nostalgia many people feel for childhood landscapes, whether rural homelands, urban neighborhoods, or natural settings. These personal attachments interweave with collective attachments shared by families, communities, and cultural groups, creating layers of meaning that accumulate over time. The sociologist David Lowenthal, in his extensive research on landscape perception, found that people often develop stronger attachments to places that have been transformed by human activity than to pristine natural areas, suggesting that cultural meaning enhances rather than diminishes emotional connections to landscape. This finding challenges assumptions that cultural landscape management should prioritize naturalness over cultural significance, highlighting instead the importance of human meaning in creating valued places.

Memory plays a crucial role in place attachment, as personal and collective memories become embedded in landscapes, creating what the cultural geographer Doreen Massey called "landscapes of memory." These memories can be personal, as when a specific tree or building reminds someone of significant life events, or collective, as when landscapes commemorate historical events or cultural narratives. The Gettysburg Battlefield in the United States, for instance, serves as both a physical place and a landscape of memory where personal recollections of visitors intersect with collective memories of the Civil War, creating a powerful sense of place that transcends the physical characteristics of the site. Similarly, indigenous sacred landscapes often incorporate memories of ancestral events, creation stories, and cultural practices that have occurred over centuries or millennia, creating deep temporal dimensions of place attachment that can be difficult for outsiders to fully comprehend.

The development and persistence of place attachment over time have significant implications for cultural landscape management. When management decisions alter or disrupt landscapes to which people have formed strong attachments, the psychological impact can be profound, leading to grief, anger, and resistance. The construction of dams that flood ancestral landscapes, the development of urban areas that destroy familiar neighborhoods, or the modification of agricultural practices that transform rural landscapes can all trigger powerful emotional responses that reflect the depth of place attachment. Conversely, cultural landscape management that recognizes and respects these attachments can strengthen community identity, enhance well-being, and build support for conservation initiatives. The management of the Lake District National Park in England, for example, has gradually evolved to recognize the deep place attachments of both residents and visitors, incorporating elements of cultural heritage preservation alongside natural conservation to maintain the qualities that people value about the landscape.

Research in environmental psychology has identified several dimensions of place attachment that are particularly relevant to cultural landscape management. These include place identity, the extent to which a place contributes to a person's sense of self; place dependence, the functional importance of a place for supporting particular activities or lifestyles; and affective attachment, the emotional bonds formed with a place. These dimensions interact in complex ways, varying across individuals, cultures, and types of landscapes. A farmer might develop strong place dependence on agricultural landscapes that support livelihood, while simultaneously forming place identity through generations of family connection to the land. A visitor to a sacred site might experience powerful affective attachment even without long-term familiarity, as spiritual significance transcends personal experience. Understanding these different dimensions of place attachment helps cultural landscape managers anticipate how different stakeholders might respond to management decisions and develop approaches that respect diverse relationships with landscape.

The diverse values associated with cultural landscapes represent another crucial theoretical foundation for understanding and managing these places. Cultural landscape values encompass a wide spectrum of meanings, benefits, and significances that different individuals and groups ascribe to landscapes, reflecting the multiple ways that landscapes matter to human societies. These values are not inherent properties of landscapes themselves but are assigned through cultural processes, reflecting particular worldviews, priorities, and experiences. Understanding the range of values associated with cultural landscapes is essential for effective management, as different values may suggest different management priorities and approaches. The challenge lies in recognizing and respecting multiple values while making decisions that often require trade-offs and compromises.

Cultural values represent one of the most fundamental categories of significance for cultural landscapes, encompassing the ways that landscapes express and sustain cultural identity, traditions, knowledge systems, and practices. These values are particularly evident in landscapes that serve as settings for cultural practices, whether agricultural rituals, religious ceremonies, artistic traditions, or community gatherings. The rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, for instance, embody cultural values related to cooperative labor, ancestral knowledge, and spiritual relationships with the environment, reflecting the Ifugao worldview in their physical form and management practices. Similarly, the traditional olive groves of the Mediterranean region represent not only agricultural systems but cultural values related to patience, continuity, and harmony between human activity and natural processes. Cultural values often emphasize continuity and tradition, suggesting management approaches that maintain practices and relationships that have sustained landscapes over generations.

Spiritual and religious values constitute another important category of significance for many cultural landscapes, reflecting the ways that places serve as connections between human communities and broader spiritual realities. These values may be associated with formally recognized sacred sites, such as temples, churches, or shrines, or with natural features imbued with spiritual significance, such as mountains, rivers, or groves. The sacred landscape of Uluru in Australia, for instance, derives its significance from the complex spiritual associations that Anangu Aboriginal people have with the rock formation and surrounding features, which feature prominently in creation stories and ongoing religious practices. Similarly, the sacred groves found throughout Africa, Asia, and other regions represent landscapes set aside for spiritual purposes, often protected through traditional religious prohibitions that have proven remarkably effective for conservation. Spiritual values in cultural landscapes often emphasize respect, reverence, and restraint, suggesting management approaches that prioritize the integrity of sacred relationships over utilitarian uses.

Historical values relate to the capacity of cultural landscapes to provide tangible connections to past events, people, and ways of life, serving as physical records of human history and experience. These values are particularly evident in landscapes that preserve material evidence of historical periods, events, or processes, from battlefield sites that commemorate significant conflicts to industrial landscapes that document technological and economic transformations. the Ironbridge Gorge in England, recognized as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, embodies historical values related to technological innovation, social change, and economic development, preserving the physical evidence of early industrial processes within a distinctive landscape setting. Historical values often emphasize authenticity and material integrity, suggesting management approaches that preserve physical evidence while allowing for appropriate interpretation and education.

Aesthetic values encompass the visual and sensory qualities of cultural landscapes that provide beauty, inspiration, and sensory pleasure. These values have played a crucial role in landscape appreciation and conservation since the 18th century, when the Romantic movement celebrated certain types of landscapes as particularly beautiful or sublime. The English Lake District, with its combination of mountains, lakes, and picturesque valleys, exemplifies a cultural landscape valued primarily for its aesthetic qualities, which have inspired countless artists, writers, and visitors over more than two centuries. Aesthetic values are often highly subjective, varying across cultures and historical periods, reflecting changing tastes and preferences. The Chinese tradition of shan shui (mountain-water) painting, for instance, developed aesthetic ideals quite different from those of Western landscape traditions, emphasizing harmony, balance, and spiritual resonance over realistic representation. Aesthetic values often emphasize scenic quality and sensory experience, suggesting management approaches that maintain distinctive visual and sensory characteristics while allowing for appropriate visitor access and enjoyment.

Social values relate to the ways that cultural landscapes provide settings for social interaction, community building, and cultural transmission. These values are particularly evident in landscapes that serve as gathering places, community centers, or settings for shared activities and experiences. The public squares of European cities, the village greens of New England towns, and the community gardens found in urban areas worldwide all exemplify landscapes valued primarily for their social functions, providing spaces where people come together, interact, and build community. Social values often emphasize accessibility, inclusivity, and functionality, suggesting management approaches that maintain or enhance the capacity of landscapes to serve social purposes while respecting their other values.

Economic values represent the tangible benefits that cultural landscapes provide through tourism, agriculture, resource extraction, and other productive activities. These values have become increasingly prominent in recent decades as the economic potential of cultural landscapes has been recognized and developed. The vineyard landscapes of regions like Bordeaux, Napa Valley, and the Douro Valley demonstrate how cultural landscapes can generate significant economic benefits through agricultural production, tourism, and related industries. Economic values often emphasize productivity, marketability, and return on investment, suggesting management approaches that balance economic development with the conservation of other values that may be more vulnerable to commercial pressures.

The challenge of managing landscapes with multiple and sometimes conflicting values represents one of the most complex aspects of cultural landscape management. Different stakeholders may prioritize different values based on their interests, perspectives, and relationships with the landscape, leading to disagreements about appropriate management approaches. A farmer might value agricultural productivity, a conservationist might value biodiversity, a historian might value historical integrity, and a tourism operator might value visual appeal—all within the same landscape. These conflicting values require careful negotiation and balancing, often through participatory processes that bring diverse stakeholders together to develop shared understandings and mutually acceptable management approaches. The concept of "values pluralism," which acknowledges the legitimacy of multiple values and seeks to find ways to accommodate them rather than privileging one above all others, offers a promising framework for addressing these challenges in cultural landscape management.

The evolution of heritage paradigms over time has profoundly influenced how cultural landscapes are understood, valued, and managed. Heritage paradigms represent coherent sets of assumptions, values, and approaches that shape how societies identify, protect, and engage with heritage, including cultural landscapes. These paradigms are not merely theoretical constructs but powerful frameworks that determine what gets recognized as heritage, how it is documented and interpreted, who has authority over it, and how decisions are made about its future. Understanding the shifting paradigms of heritage conservation provides crucial context for contemporary approaches to cultural landscape management, revealing both the progress that

## Section 4: Types and Classifications of Cultural Landscapes

The evolution of heritage paradigms has profoundly influenced how cultural landscapes are understood, valued, and managed. Heritage paradigms represent coherent sets of assumptions, values, and approaches that shape how societies identify, protect, and engage with heritage, including cultural landscapes. These paradigms are not merely theoretical constructs but powerful frameworks that determine what gets recognized as heritage, how it is documented and interpreted, who has authority over it, and how decisions are made about its future. Understanding the shifting paradigms of heritage conservation provides crucial context for contemporary approaches to cultural landscape management, revealing both the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain. As we move from theoretical foundations to practical applications, the classification of cultural landscapes emerges as a crucial tool for organizing knowledge, guiding management approaches, and facilitating communication about these complex places. The diversity of cultural landscapes around the world defies simple categorization, yet classification systems provide valuable frameworks for understanding their characteristics, values, and management needs.

The most influential classification system for cultural landscapes emerged from the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, which formally recognized cultural landscapes as a distinct category of heritage in 1992. This recognition represented a significant evolution in heritage thinking, acknowledging that the interaction between people and their environment constitutes a fundamental aspect of human heritage worthy of international recognition and protection. The UNESCO classification system, developed through expert meetings and refined through practical application, identifies three main categories of cultural landscapes that reflect different types of relationships between human activity and the natural environment. This system has not only guided the identification and inscription of World Heritage cultural landscapes but has also influenced national and regional heritage frameworks worldwide, becoming a reference point for understanding cultural landscape diversity.

The first category in the UNESCO system is designed landscapes, which are intentionally created by humans for aesthetic, functional, or symbolic purposes. These landscapes result from deliberate design by a landscape architect, gardener, or patron, reflecting particular aesthetic ideals, philosophical concepts, or social aspirations. Designed landscapes often embody the highest expressions of garden and landscape art, demonstrating human creativity and technical skill in shaping the environment according to predetermined visions. The gardens of Versailles in France, designed by André Le Nôtre in the 17th century, exemplify this category, with their grand axial layouts, geometric parterres, and carefully controlled vistas expressing the absolutist political philosophy of Louis XIV's reign. Similarly, the classical gardens of Suzhou in China, dating back to the 11th century but reaching their peak during the Ming and Qing dynasties, demonstrate sophisticated design principles that balance natural elements with human artistry to create miniature idealized landscapes that embody philosophical concepts of harmony between humans and nature. What distinguishes designed landscapes is the presence of a clear design intention that can be documented and understood through historical research, providing a framework for their conservation and management. The challenge in managing designed landscapes lies in preserving the integrity of the original design concept while allowing for the natural evolution of living elements and accommodating contemporary uses. The restoration of the gardens at the Château de Villandry in France during the early 20th century illustrates both the possibilities and complexities of this approach, where extensive research into historical documents and archaeological evidence guided the recreation of Renaissance gardens that had been altered over centuries, demonstrating how designed landscapes can be revitalized through careful attention to design intention.

The second UNESCO category encompasses organically evolved landscapes, which result from social, economic, administrative, and/or religious imperatives that have shaped the landscape over time. Unlike designed landscapes, these places develop incrementally through the accumulated actions of multiple generations rather than through a single intentional design process. UNESCO further divides this category into two subcategories: relict (or fossil) landscapes, where the evolutionary process came to an end at some point in the past, and continuing landscapes, which retain active social roles in contemporary society. Relict landscapes preserve evidence of past ways of life and land use practices, offering valuable insights into historical human-environment relationships. The archaeological landscape of Stonehenge and Avebury in England exemplifies this subcategory, preserving not only the famous stone circles but also the broader context of burial mounds, processional avenues, and settlement sites that together form a complex prehistoric cultural landscape. These features survive as relict elements of a Neolithic and Bronze Age cultural system that no longer functions as originally intended, requiring management approaches that prioritize preservation and interpretation over continuity of traditional practices. In contrast, continuing organically evolved landscapes remain active and dynamic, with traditional practices continuing to shape their character. The vineyard landscapes of the Piedmont region in Italy, particularly those associated with Barolo and Barbaresco wines, demonstrate this subcategory, where centuries of viticultural practices have created distinctive landscape patterns that continue to evolve while maintaining essential characteristics. The management of continuing landscapes requires balancing the preservation of traditional practices with necessary adaptations to changing economic, environmental, and social conditions, ensuring that these landscapes remain viable for the communities that sustain them. The rice terraces of the Cordilleras in the Philippines, though facing significant challenges from outmigration and changing economic conditions, illustrate ongoing efforts to maintain traditional agricultural practices while adapting to contemporary realities, demonstrating the dynamic nature of continuing organically evolved landscapes.

The third UNESCO category encompasses associative cultural landscapes, which are valued primarily for religious, artistic, or cultural associations with natural elements rather than for material cultural evidence. These landscapes derive their significance from intangible relationships between people and places, often embodying spiritual beliefs, cultural narratives, or artistic inspirations. The power of associative landscapes lies not in physical modifications to the environment but in the meanings and values attributed to natural features by human societies. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in Australia exemplifies this category, where the massive sandstone monolith of Uluru and the nearby rock domes of Kata Tjuta derive their World Heritage significance primarily from their deep spiritual and cultural importance to the Anangu Aboriginal people rather than from any physical modifications made by humans. The Tjuṯa (stories) associated with these features form the foundation of Anangu religion, law, and knowledge system, creating a landscape that is both physically impressive and culturally profound. Similarly, Mount Fuji in Japan represents an associative cultural landscape where the natural mountain itself, rather than human modifications, holds cultural significance as a sacred site, artistic subject, and national symbol. The challenge in managing associative landscapes lies in protecting the intangible values and relationships that give them meaning while accommodating legitimate contemporary uses such as tourism, recreation, or resource extraction. The joint management arrangement at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, where traditional Anangu owners work alongside government agencies, demonstrates one approach to this challenge, integrating traditional knowledge systems with contemporary management practices to protect both the physical landscape and its cultural significance.

The UNESCO classification system has proven remarkably influential since its introduction in 1992, providing a framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing cultural landscapes worldwide. By 2023, over 120 cultural landscapes had been inscribed on the World Heritage List, representing all three categories and demonstrating the global applicability of the classification system. The significance of this system extends beyond World Heritage inscription to influence national heritage policies, professional practices, and public understanding of cultural landscapes. However, the system is not without limitations. The rigid distinctions between categories sometimes struggle to accommodate the complexity of real-world landscapes that may exhibit characteristics of multiple categories. For instance, the English Lake District, inscribed as a World Heritage cultural landscape in 2017, combines elements of designed landscapes (in the form of country house parks and gardens), organically evolved landscapes (in its agricultural patterns and settlement forms), and associative landscapes (in its artistic and literary associations). This complexity suggests that while classification systems provide valuable frameworks, they should be applied flexibly to recognize the multifaceted nature of many cultural landscapes.

Beyond the UNESCO framework, designed landscapes represent a particularly rich and diverse category of cultural landscapes that merit closer examination. Designed landscapes encompass a wide spectrum of human creativity and intention, from the grandest royal gardens to humble domestic spaces, all unified by the element of deliberate design that shapes their form and character. What distinguishes designed landscapes from other types of cultural landscapes is the presence of a clear design intention that can be documented and understood through historical research, providing a framework for their conservation and management. This intention may be expressed through formal plans, written descriptions, visual representations, or the physical evidence of the landscape itself, revealing how designers and patrons sought to shape the environment according to particular aesthetic, functional, or symbolic purposes.

Historic gardens represent perhaps the most recognized type of designed cultural landscape, embodying the highest expressions of garden art across different cultures and periods. The gardens of the Alhambra in Spain, created during the Islamic Nasrid dynasty in the 14th century, exemplify the sophisticated integration of architecture, water features, and planting that characterizes Islamic garden design. These gardens, with their carefully orchestrated sequence of spaces, intricate water systems, and symbolic plantings, create earthly paradises that reflect both aesthetic ideals and philosophical concepts. The Court of the Lions, with its famous fountain supported by twelve marble lions, combines architectural refinement with hydraulic engineering and botanical knowledge to create a space that appeals to multiple senses while embodying Islamic concepts of paradise. Similarly, the Mughal gardens of Kashmir, particularly the Shalimar Bagh built by Emperor Jahangir in the 17th century, demonstrate how garden design can express political power while creating spaces of beauty and contemplation. These gardens, with their terraced layout, flowing water channels, and carefully selected plantings, adapt Persian garden traditions to the unique topography and climate of Kashmir, resulting in a distinctive regional expression of Islamic garden design.

European garden history offers a particularly rich tradition of designed landscapes that have influenced garden design worldwide. The Italian Renaissance gardens of the 15th and 16th centuries, such as those at Villa d'Este in Tivoli and Villa Lante in Bagnaia, marked a significant departure from medieval enclosed gardens, creating dynamic spatial experiences that engaged with surrounding landscapes through carefully composed vistas. These gardens introduced the concept of the garden as a sequence of outdoor rooms, each with distinct character and purpose, connected by axial paths and unified by consistent design principles. The French formal garden that reached its zenith with André Le Nôtre's work at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles in the 17th century represented a further evolution, emphasizing grand scale, geometric precision, and visual control over nature. Le Nôtre's designs transformed the surrounding countryside through extensive earthmoving, tree planting, and hydraulic engineering, creating landscapes that expressed the absolutist political philosophy of Louis XIV's reign while demonstrating unprecedented technical mastery over the environment. The English landscape garden that emerged in the 18th century as a reaction against French formality offered yet another approach, exemplified by the work of Lancelot "Capability" Brown at places like Stowe and Blenheim Palace. These gardens sought to create idealized natural landscapes through the careful arrangement of landforms, water features, trees, and architectural elements, establishing a new aesthetic that would influence park design worldwide and shape perceptions of natural beauty for generations.

Designed landscapes extend beyond formal gardens to encompass broader landscape designs that shape entire territories. The 19th-century garden city movement, pioneered by Ebenezer Howard in Britain and implemented in places like Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City, represented an ambitious attempt to design entire communities according to principles that balanced urban convenience with access to nature. These garden cities integrated residential areas with greenbelts, agricultural land, and public parks, creating distinctive landscape patterns that reflected social ideals about healthy living and community organization. Similarly, the City Beautiful movement in the United States, exemplified by the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and subsequent civic improvement projects, sought to design urban landscapes that would inspire civic virtue and social order through monumental planning, formal public spaces, and extensive park systems. The landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, whose work includes Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, approached urban landscape design as a means of promoting democratic values and public health, creating designed landscapes that continue to shape the experience of American cities today.

The management of designed landscapes presents unique challenges that reflect their inherent tension between intention and evolution. Unlike buildings, which can often be preserved in a relatively fixed state, designed landscapes contain living elements—plants, trees, water systems—that naturally change over time, creating a fundamental conflict between the desire to preserve the original design intent and the necessity of accommodating natural processes. The restoration of the gardens at the Château de Villandry in France during the early 20th century illustrates both the possibilities and complexities of managing designed landscapes. When the Carvallo family acquired the property in 1906, the gardens had been altered significantly from their Renaissance design, with formal parterres replaced by an English landscape park. Through extensive historical research, including the study of engravings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau from the 16th century, the family recreated the original garden layout, including the famous ornamental vegetable gardens (potager) and love gardens (jardin d'amour). This restoration project demonstrates how historical research can guide the revitalization of designed landscapes, but it also raises questions about authenticity when living landscapes are recreated according to historical designs rather than preserved through continuous tradition.

Contemporary approaches to managing designed landscapes increasingly recognize the need to balance historical integrity with ecological sustainability and social relevance. The management of the historic gardens at Hidcote Manor in England, created by Lawrence Johnston in the early 20th century, exemplifies this balanced approach. The National Trust, which acquired the property in 1948, has maintained the garden's distinctive Arts and Crafts character while adapting horticultural practices to reduce environmental impacts, such as collecting rainwater for irrigation and reducing chemical pesticide use. Similarly, the management of the historic landscapes of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., addresses both preservation and contemporary needs, maintaining the original design principles of Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. while incorporating sustainable practices and accommodating modern security requirements. These examples demonstrate how designed landscapes can remain vital and meaningful while respecting their historical significance, suggesting a path forward for the management of cultural landscapes that acknowledges both their past and their future.

Evolving landscapes represent another major category of cultural landscapes, distinguished by their development through ongoing human-environment interactions rather than through intentional design. These landscapes, which UNESCO categorizes as organically evolved, result from the accumulated actions of multiple generations responding to environmental conditions, economic needs, social structures, and cultural values. What characterizes evolving landscapes is their dynamic nature—they are not fixed creations but living systems that continue to change and adapt while maintaining essential characteristics shaped by historical processes. The management of evolving landscapes therefore requires approaches that respect their historical trajectories while allowing for necessary adaptation to changing conditions, ensuring their continued relevance and vitality for the communities that sustain them.

Agricultural landscapes constitute perhaps the most widespread and significant type of evolving cultural landscape, covering vast areas of the Earth's surface and supporting human communities for millennia. These landscapes reflect the intimate relationship between human societies and their environments, embodying traditional knowledge systems, technological adaptations, and cultural values related to food production and land stewardship. The rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1995, exemplify agricultural landscapes that have evolved over approximately 2,000 years through the continuous adaptation of Ifugao farmers to steep mountain terrain. The terraces, which cover approximately 20,000 square kilometers and climb to elevations of 1,500 meters, demonstrate sophisticated engineering knowledge, water management systems, and ecological understanding developed over countless generations. Each terrace system incorporates irrigation channels, drainage systems, and forested watersheds that work together to create stable agricultural ecosystems in challenging environmental conditions. The Ifugao rice terraces represent not only a remarkable agricultural achievement but also a complex cultural system that integrates agricultural practices with social organization, spiritual beliefs, and artistic traditions, demonstrating how evolving landscapes embody multiple dimensions of human experience and knowledge.

European agricultural landscapes offer additional examples of evolving cultural landscapes that reflect long-term human-environment interactions. The bocage landscape of Normandy in France, characterized by its intricate network of hedgerows enclosing small fields, developed over centuries as farmers adapted to the region's rolling topography and dispersed settlement patterns. This landscape pattern, though modified by agricultural modernization in the mid-20th century, has been partially restored in recent decades as its ecological and cultural values have been recognized. Similarly, the dehesa landscapes of Spain and Portugal represent an ancient agro-silvo-pastoral system that has shaped the Iberian peninsula for centuries. These open woodlands, dominated by cork and holm oaks, provide multiple products including cork, acorns for pig grazing, pasture for livestock, and fuelwood, creating a sustainable land use system that maintains high biodiversity while supporting rural economies. The dehesa system, which covers approximately 3.5 million hectares in southwestern Europe, demonstrates how evolving landscapes can integrate productive functions with ecological values, creating resilient systems that have persisted through changing economic and environmental conditions.

The distinction between relict and continuing evolving landscapes, as recognized by UNESCO, has important implications for management approaches. Relict landscapes, where the evolutionary process came to an end at some point in the past, primarily require preservation and interpretation rather than the continuation of traditional practices. The abandoned agricultural terraces of the Inca Empire in Peru, such as those at Moray with its circular terraces thought to have been used for agricultural experimentation, preserve evidence of sophisticated ancient technologies but no longer function as originally intended. The management of these re

## Section 5: Assessment and Documentation Methods

The management of these relict evolving landscapes presents unique challenges that differ significantly from those of continuing landscapes. While continuing landscapes require approaches that balance tradition with adaptation, relict landscapes demand careful preservation of material evidence and thoughtful interpretation that can communicate their historical significance to contemporary audiences. The abandoned agricultural terraces of the Inca Empire in Peru, such as those at Moray with its circular terraces thought to have been used for agricultural experimentation, preserve evidence of sophisticated ancient technologies but no longer function as originally intended. Understanding and managing such complex cultural landscapes requires robust assessment and documentation methods that can capture their multifaceted nature, historical development, and cultural significance. These methods form the foundation of effective cultural landscape management, providing the essential information needed to make informed decisions about conservation, interpretation, and sustainable use.

Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) represents one of the most fundamental methodologies for understanding cultural landscapes, providing a systematic approach to identifying, describing, and evaluating the distinctive characteristics that give landscapes their unique identity. Developed primarily in the United Kingdom during the 1990s but now applied internationally, LCA moves beyond simple inventory of landscape features to analyze the patterns, components, and qualities that together create a sense of place and distinctiveness. The methodology typically involves several interconnected steps, beginning with the identification of Landscape Character Types (LCTs), which are broad categories of landscape with similar patterns of features, such as "upland moorland" or "lowland farmland with hedgerows." These types are further refined into Landscape Character Areas (LCAs), which are specific geographic units with a unique combination of physical and cultural characteristics that give them a distinctive local identity.

The English Landscape Character Assessment program, initiated by the Countryside Agency in the 1990s and now continued by Natural England, provides a comprehensive example of this methodology applied at a national scale. This program divided England into 159 Joint Character Areas, each described in terms of its physical attributes (geology, landform, soils), cultural features (settlement patterns, field systems, land use), and perceptual qualities (tranquility, wildness, remoteness). Each Character Area was documented through detailed descriptions, maps, and photographs, creating a rich resource that has informed planning decisions, conservation priorities, and landscape management strategies across the country. The assessment of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, for instance, identified its distinctive character as resulting from the underlying geology of sandstone and clay, the historic pattern of small irregular fields, ancient woodlands, scattered settlements, and the pervasive presence of livestock grazing. This understanding has guided management policies that seek to maintain these characteristics while accommodating necessary change, demonstrating how landscape character assessment can translate into practical management action.

Landscape Character Assessment employs various techniques to describe and evaluate landscape character, including desk-based analysis of maps, aerial photographs, and historical records, combined with field verification to ground-truth observations and assess perceptual qualities. The evaluation process typically considers both the intrinsic value of landscape character (its distinctiveness, rarity, condition) and its value to people (its aesthetic, cultural, recreational, and experiential qualities). The Scottish Landscape Character Assessment program, developed by Scottish Natural Heritage, introduced an innovative approach by incorporating public perception studies, which used questionnaires and focus groups to understand how different people experience and value landscapes. This revealed significant variations in perception between different groups, with farmers, tourists, and local residents often attaching different values to the same landscape features, highlighting the importance of considering multiple perspectives in landscape assessment.

The applications of Landscape Character Assessment in management planning are extensive and continue to expand as the methodology evolves. In England, the National Character Areas have been integrated into the National Planning Policy Framework, providing spatial evidence to inform local development plans and decisions about landscape change. At a more local scale, Landscape Character Assessments have been used to develop detailed landscape management strategies, such as the Cotswolds Landscape Strategy, which sets out policies and actions to conserve and enhance the distinctive character of this protected landscape. Internationally, the methodology has been adapted to different contexts, from the European Landscape Convention's emphasis on landscape assessment across all landscapes (not just designated ones) to applications in developing countries where the approach has been modified to address different cultural contexts and data availability. The Landscape Character Assessment of the Maloti-Drakensberg region in southern Africa, for instance, integrated traditional ecological knowledge with conventional landscape analysis to develop a more culturally appropriate understanding of landscape character in this transboundary area.

Historical research methods provide another essential dimension of cultural landscape assessment, revealing the layers of human activity and environmental change that have shaped landscapes over time. Unlike Landscape Character Assessment, which focuses primarily on contemporary landscape patterns, historical research seeks to understand the processes, decisions, and events that created those patterns, providing a temporal depth that is crucial for informed management. This research draws on diverse sources and techniques, each offering different insights into the historical development of landscapes and the meanings they have held for past generations.

Archival research forms the backbone of historical landscape investigation, drawing on written records, maps, plans, paintings, photographs, and other documentary evidence to reconstruct past landscape conditions and understand the forces that shaped them. The richness of archival sources varies significantly by region and period, with European landscapes often documented through centuries of manorial records, estate maps, enclosure awards, tithe maps, and detailed estate accounts, while landscapes in other parts of the world may have shorter or different documentary traditions. The historical research underpinning the management of the Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey World Heritage Site in England, for instance, drew on an extraordinary range of archival sources, including 12th-century monastic records, 18th-century landscape garden plans, estate accounts detailing planting schemes, and visitor descriptions from different periods. This research revealed how the landscape had evolved from a medieval monastic precinct to an 18th-century designed landscape to a 20th-century public park, providing essential context for conservation decisions that respected all layers of its history.

Cartographic analysis represents a particularly powerful technique in historical landscape research, as maps provide direct visual evidence of past landscape conditions and changes over time. The sequential analysis of maps from different periods can reveal patterns of continuity and change in field systems, settlement patterns, land use, and other landscape features. The research into the historical landscape of the Dutch polder region, for instance, used a sequence of maps dating from the 16th century to the present to trace the evolution of reclamation patterns, drainage systems, and settlement layouts, revealing how each generation adapted to and modified the landscape according to changing technologies and needs. Similarly, the analysis of historic Ordnance Survey maps in Britain has allowed researchers to reconstruct lost landscape features such as vanished hedgerows, filled-in ponds, and demolished buildings, providing important evidence for landscape restoration projects. The increasing digitization of historic map collections has greatly enhanced this analytical capability, allowing for precise overlaying of maps from different periods and the creation of time-series visualizations of landscape change.

Oral history and traditional knowledge documentation offer complementary perspectives to archival research, capturing the memories, experiences, and understandings of people who have direct connections to landscapes. These methodologies are particularly important for documenting recent landscape changes, intangible cultural values, and traditional ecological knowledge that may not be recorded in written sources. The Stó:lō Oral History Project in British Columbia, Canada, for instance, recorded the memories and knowledge of Stó:lō elders about their traditional territories, revealing deep cultural understandings of landscape features that were invisible to conventional archaeological or historical research. These oral accounts documented place names that described landscape characteristics, traditional resource management practices, and cultural narratives that connected specific places to broader cosmological understandings, providing essential context for landscape management that respected indigenous perspectives and values. Similarly, the collection of oral histories from farmers in the Yorkshire Dales National Park captured detailed knowledge of traditional farming practices, hedgerow management techniques, and local ecological relationships that were not recorded in official documents but were crucial for understanding the historical development of this agricultural landscape.

Methods for reconstructing historical landscape conditions and trajectories have become increasingly sophisticated, integrating multiple sources of evidence to create comprehensive understanding of landscape change. Environmental archaeology techniques, including pollen analysis, soil analysis, and dendrochronology, can provide evidence of past vegetation cover, land use practices, and environmental conditions that extends back thousands of years, complementing the more recent evidence provided by historical documents. The research into the historical landscape of the English Lake District, for instance, combined pollen analysis from lake sediments (showing vegetation changes over the last 10,000 years), archaeological evidence of prehistoric settlement, historical records of medieval land use, and 18th-century literary descriptions to create a multi-layered understanding of how this iconic landscape evolved. This integrated approach revealed not only the sequence of landscape changes but also the interactions between environmental factors and human decisions that shaped the landscape, providing essential context for contemporary management decisions about issues such as woodland expansion, grazing levels, and visitor management.

Field survey techniques provide the essential ground-truthing component of cultural landscape assessment, allowing researchers to directly observe, record, and evaluate landscape features, conditions, and relationships that may not be fully apparent from desk-based research or remote sensing. These techniques range from rapid reconnaissance surveys to detailed feature recording, all sharing the fundamental characteristic of direct engagement with the landscape in situ. Field survey remains irreplaceable in cultural landscape assessment, as it captures the experiential qualities of landscapes—their sounds, smells, textures, and atmospheres—that cannot be conveyed through maps, documents, or digital representations alone.

Landscape feature recording and mapping form the foundation of most field survey approaches, systematically documenting the physical components that contribute to landscape character. This recording typically includes both natural features (landforms, watercourses, vegetation patterns) and cultural features (settlements, field boundaries, archaeological sites, buildings), noting their location, condition, materials, and relationships to other features. The Historic Landscape Characterization program in Wales, for instance, employed field surveyors to systematically record landscape features across the country, using standardized forms and GIS to create a comprehensive database of landscape components. This field-based approach revealed patterns and relationships that were not apparent from map analysis alone, such as subtle variations in wall construction techniques that indicated different periods of enclosure or the survival of traditional management practices in particular areas. The detailed field recording of the hay meadows in the Rhön Biosphere Reserve in Germany similarly documented the complex mosaic of plant species, management techniques, and topographic variations that created this distinctive landscape, providing essential baseline information for monitoring and management.

Condition assessment methodologies evaluate the current state of landscape features and their susceptibility to change or degradation, providing crucial information for prioritizing conservation actions and monitoring change over time. These assessments typically evaluate both physical condition (such as the structural integrity of walls, buildings, or earthworks) and ecological condition (such as the species diversity of grasslands, woodlands, or wetlands), recognizing that cultural landscapes often derive their significance from the interaction between cultural and natural elements. The condition monitoring program for the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site in Britain, for instance, uses standardized survey protocols to regularly assess the condition of archaeological remains, boundary features, and vegetation across the entire landscape, allowing managers to identify deteriorating features and target resources effectively. Similarly, the condition assessment of vernacular architecture in the Svaneti region of Georgia documented not only the physical state of medieval stone towers but also the continuity of traditional building knowledge and practices, recognizing that the cultural significance of these structures depended on both their physical presence and the living traditions associated with them.

Photographic documentation techniques provide powerful tools for recording landscape conditions, changes over time, and the experiential qualities of places. Systematic photography, using standardized locations, angles, and conditions, allows for precise comparison of landscape changes, while more interpretive photography can capture the atmosphere, character, and sensory qualities that make landscapes distinctive. The repeat photography project in the Swiss National Park, which precisely replicated historical photographs taken since the park's establishment in 1914, created a remarkable visual record of landscape change over more than a century, revealing patterns of forest regeneration, glacier retreat, and meadow succession that provided valuable insights into ecological processes and management effectiveness. Similarly, the photographic documentation of seasonal changes in traditional agricultural landscapes, such as the rice terraces of Bali, captures the dynamic qualities of these landscapes and the sophisticated timing of agricultural activities that shape them, providing important context for understanding their cultural significance.

Participatory field survey methods involving local communities have increasingly been recognized as valuable approaches that combine technical documentation with local knowledge and engagement. These methods recognize that people who live and work in landscapes often possess detailed knowledge of landscape features, conditions, and changes that may not be apparent to external researchers, while also building local support for and involvement in landscape management. The community-based landscape mapping project in the Kitengela conservation area in Kenya, for instance, trained local pastoralists to document landscape features, resources, and changes using GPS and simple mapping techniques, creating detailed maps that integrated scientific and traditional knowledge systems. Similarly, the Parish Landscape Character Assessment projects in England involved local communities in documenting and evaluating their local landscapes, using workshops, field visits, and mapping exercises to capture local perspectives and values. These participatory approaches not only produced more comprehensive landscape assessments but also built local capacity and ownership of landscape management processes, demonstrating how technical documentation methods can be adapted to support community engagement and empowerment.

Digital documentation technologies have revolutionized cultural landscape assessment in recent decades, providing powerful new tools for capturing, analyzing, and communicating information about landscapes. These technologies range from sophisticated spatial analysis systems to immersive visualization techniques, all offering enhanced capabilities for understanding complex landscape patterns, processes, and changes. The integration of digital technologies with traditional assessment methods has created new possibilities for comprehensive, multi-dimensional landscape documentation that can inform more effective management decisions.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become fundamental tools in cultural landscape assessment, providing platforms for integrating, analyzing, and visualizing diverse types of spatial data. GIS allows researchers to combine historical maps, aerial photographs, field survey data, satellite imagery, and other spatially referenced information in a single analytical framework, revealing patterns and relationships that would be difficult to discern through other means. The application of GIS in the assessment of the cultural landscape of the Loire Valley in France, for instance, integrated data on historical land use patterns, contemporary landscape features, ecological resources, and visitor flows to create comprehensive spatial models that informed management plans for this World Heritage site. This integrated analysis revealed previously unrecognized relationships between historic settlement patterns, agricultural practices, and biodiversity hotspots, allowing managers to develop strategies that addressed multiple objectives simultaneously. The temporal capabilities of GIS have also proven valuable for analyzing landscape change over time, as demonstrated by research into the Mediterranean landscape of Lesvos, Greece, which used historical maps, aerial photographs from different periods, and contemporary satellite imagery to reconstruct and quantify landscape changes over more than a century, providing essential evidence for understanding the dynamics of this complex cultural landscape.

Remote sensing techniques offer increasingly sophisticated methods for documenting and analyzing cultural landscapes over extensive areas, providing valuable information on landscape patterns, conditions, and changes that would be difficult to obtain through field survey alone. These techniques range from traditional aerial photography to advanced satellite-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), each offering different capabilities for landscape assessment. The use of high-resolution satellite imagery in monitoring changes in the agricultural landscapes of the Nile Delta, for instance, allowed researchers to track patterns of land use change, urban expansion, and irrigation modifications across large areas, providing essential information for landscape management in this rapidly changing region. Similarly, the application of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology in the assessment of forested landscapes in Central America revealed previously undocumented archaeological features and settlement patterns beneath the forest canopy, dramatically changing understanding of the historical development of these landscapes. The increasing accessibility of drone technology has further expanded remote sensing capabilities, allowing for highly detailed documentation of landscape features at relatively low cost. The drone survey of the traditional terraced landscapes of the Amalfi Coast in Italy, for instance, produced detailed three-dimensional models and high-resolution imagery of terrace structures and conditions, providing valuable baseline information for conservation planning and monitoring.

3D documentation methods, including laser scanning and photogrammetry, provide powerful tools for creating detailed digital records of landscape features and their contexts. These technologies capture precise three-dimensional information about the shape, size, and condition of features ranging from individual structures to entire landscape complexes, creating digital models that can be used for analysis, visualization, and conservation planning. The laser scanning of the historic water management systems at the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Alhambra in Spain produced detailed three-dimensional records of the complex hydraulic infrastructure that has sustained this landscape for centuries, providing essential information for conservation and restoration work. Similarly, the photogrammetric documentation of the traditional dry-stone wall systems in the Cinque Terre region of Italy created comprehensive digital records of these intricate structures, including precise measurements of wall dimensions, construction techniques, and current conditions, allowing for detailed analysis of structural stability and conservation needs. These 3D documentation methods not only create valuable records for conservation but also support research and interpretation by allowing detailed analysis of construction techniques, spatial relationships, and change over time.

Digital landscape modeling and visualization technologies offer new possibilities for understanding, communicating, and making decisions about cultural landscapes. These technologies range from simple visual simulations to complex interactive models that integrate multiple types of data and allow users to explore different scenarios and futures. The visual impact assessment for landscape changes in the Lake District National Park in England, for instance, used digital terrain modeling and photomontage techniques to create accurate visualizations of proposed developments from multiple viewpoints, allowing planners and decision-makers to evaluate potential impacts on landscape character more effectively. Similarly, the interactive landscape model developed for the cultural landscape of the Wachau Valley in Austria integrated historical, ecological, and cultural information in a digital platform that allowed users to explore different layers of landscape information and understand the complex relationships between them. These visualization tools have proven particularly valuable for engaging stakeholders in landscape planning processes, making complex landscape information more accessible and supporting more informed discussions about landscape futures.

The integration of different digital technologies in landscape assessment represents a frontier of methodological innovation, as researchers and practitioners develop new ways to combine the capabilities of different systems to create more comprehensive and powerful assessment approaches. The Digital Landscape Heritage project in Germany, for instance, combined GIS, 3D modeling, virtual reality, and database systems to create an integrated platform for documenting, analyzing
