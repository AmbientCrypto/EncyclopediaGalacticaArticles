                1: Introduction to Temporal Cryptography and the Need
                for Verifiable Delay Functions</h2>
                <p>The relentless march of time, an immutable constant
                in the physical universe, has long proven frustratingly
                elusive in the digital realm. Cryptography, the science
                of secure communication in adversarial environments,
                excels at guaranteeing properties like confidentiality,
                integrity, and authenticity across vast, untrusted
                networks. Yet, until the advent of Verifiable Delay
                Functions (VDFs), one fundamental property remained
                agonizingly difficult to secure: the verifiable passage
                of <em>time itself</em>. This section explores the
                profound challenges of establishing trusted time in
                decentralized systems, introduces VDFs as the
                groundbreaking cryptographic primitive designed to
                overcome these limitations, traces their conceptual
                lineage, and illuminates their transformative
                significance for a new generation of secure and fair
                protocols.</p>

                id="the-problem-of-trusted-time-in-distributed-systems">1.1
                The Problem of Trusted Time in Distributed Systems</h3>
                <p>Distributed systems, particularly decentralized
                networks like blockchains, operate without a central
                authority. Achieving consensus on the state of the
                system – what transactions happened, in what order – is
                their core challenge. Time, or more precisely, the
                ordering of events and the prevention of certain
                attacks, is inextricably linked to this consensus
                process. Traditional approaches have proven deeply
                flawed:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW): Energy Waste and
                Parallelism:</strong> Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin
                ingeniously used computational work (PoW) as a proxy for
                time. Miners race to solve arbitrary cryptographic
                puzzles, and the first to succeed proposes the next
                block. While effective in establishing probabilistic
                ordering, PoW suffers from two critical deficiencies
                regarding <em>time</em>:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Massive Energy Consumption:</strong> The
                “work” is deliberately wasteful. Miners expend colossal
                amounts of electricity (estimates suggest Bitcoin alone
                consumes over 130 Terawatt-hours annually – comparable
                to entire countries like Argentina) performing
                quintillions of computations per second, solely to prove
                a time interval passed. This environmental cost became
                increasingly untenable as blockchain adoption
                grew.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parallelization Vulnerability:</strong>
                PoW puzzles are designed to be <em>easy to verify</em>
                but <em>hard to solve</em>. Crucially, however, they are
                <em>embarrassingly parallelizable</em>. Throwing more
                hardware (CPUs, GPUs, then specialized ASICs) at the
                problem directly reduces the <em>perceived</em> time
                taken to find a solution. A single entity with access to
                vast computational resources (e.g., a well-funded state
                actor or a large mining pool) can significantly compress
                the time needed to mine a block or even attempt chain
                reorganizations (“51% attacks”), undermining the
                intended time delay and fairness. The security relies
                not on enforced sequentiality but on the economic
                infeasibility of amassing majority hash power – a
                barrier constantly eroded by Moore’s Law and economies
                of scale in specialized hardware.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trust Issues with Centralized
                Timestamps:</strong> An obvious alternative is relying
                on a trusted timestamping service (e.g., RFC 3161). A
                central authority cryptographically signs a document
                hash and the current time. While useful in certain
                closed systems, this model completely fails in
                trustless, decentralized environments:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Single Point of Failure/Control:</strong>
                The timestamping authority becomes a critical
                vulnerability. Compromise, coercion, or malicious action
                by this single entity invalidates the entire system’s
                temporal guarantees. Who watches the watchmen?</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lack of Verifiability:</strong>
                Participants cannot independently verify that the
                claimed time interval genuinely passed; they must simply
                trust the authority’s assertion. This is anathema to the
                principles of decentralization.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Synchronization Challenges:</strong>
                Accurately synchronizing clocks across a global,
                adversarial network (resistant to manipulation) is a
                notoriously difficult problem (the Byzantine Generals
                Problem applied to time), further complicating reliance
                on external time sources.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Timing Attacks and Consensus
                Vulnerabilities:</strong> The absence of robust,

                attacks:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Grinding Attacks:</strong> An adversary
                with significant computational resources can rapidly
                iterate through many potential solutions or block
                versions (e.g., trying different sets of transactions or
                nonces) to bias an outcome in their favor. For example,
                in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems without VDFs, a
                stakeholder might rapidly compute many potential future
                states to maximize their rewards or influence leader
                selection, exploiting the lack of an enforced time delay
                between steps.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Network Layer Manipulation:</strong>
                Adversaries controlling network relays can delay or
                reorder messages, creating artificial time advantages
                for certain participants (e.g., delaying competitors’
                blocks or transactions). This can lead to unfairness in
                leader election or transaction inclusion.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Front-Running and MEV:</strong> The
                high-frequency trading scourge of traditional finance
                found fertile ground in decentralized finance (DeFi).
                Without a verifiable temporal ordering mechanism,
                sophisticated bots can observe pending transactions in
                the public mempool, compute their potential impact
                (e.g., on token prices), and instantly submit their own
                transaction with a higher fee to execute <em>before</em>
                the original one, profiting at the user’s expense – a
                practice known as front-running, a subset of Maximal
                Extractable Value (MEV). The 2020 “bZx flash loan
                attacks” starkly illustrated how millions could be
                extracted by exploiting the lack of enforced transaction
                ordering time.</p></li>

                <p>These limitations created a stark realization:

                primitive – a way to <em>prove</em>, in a publicly
                verifiable manner, that a specific, predetermined amount
                of <em>sequential computational time</em> had elapsed,

                Defining Verifiable Delay Functions: Core Concept</h3>
                <p>Enter the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Formally
                defined around 2018, a VDF is a cryptographic primitive
                satisfying three essential properties:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Sequentiality:</strong> Evaluating the
                function <code>y = f(x)</code> must require running a
                prescribed sequence of steps for a specified time
                <code>τ</code> (e.g., <code>τ</code> seconds on a
                standard reference machine). Crucially, this computation
                <em>cannot be significantly sped up by
                parallelization</em>. Throwing more processors at the
                problem yields minimal benefit. The computation
                represents a “narrow computational alleyway” – only one
                entity can walk through at a time; widening the alley
                (adding parallel workers) doesn’t shorten the distance
                that needs to be walked sequentially.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verifiability:</strong> Given the output
                <code>y</code>, the input <code>x</code>, and the delay
                parameter <code>τ</code>, anyone can
                <em>efficiently</em> verify (in time much shorter than
                <code>τ</code>, ideally logarithmic in <code>τ</code>)
                that <code>y</code> is indeed the correct output of
                <code>f(x)</code> after <code>τ</code> sequential steps.
                This proof <code>π</code> must be succinct.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Uniqueness (or δ-Uniqueness):</strong>
                For a given input <code>x</code> and parameter
                <code>τ</code>, it must be computationally infeasible to
                find a valid output <code>y'</code> ≠ <code>y</code> and
                a proof <code>π'</code> that verifies
                <code>(x, y', τ, π')</code> as correct. The function
                should produce a single, canonical output. Some weaker
                definitions allow for a small probability
                (<code>δ</code>) of multiple valid outputs, but
                constructions aim for negligible
                <code>δ</code>.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Distinction from PoW/PoS:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>vs. PoW:</strong> VDFs share PoW’s
                requirement of computational effort but fundamentally
                differ in parallelism. PoW is massively parallelizable;
                VDFs are inherently sequential. PoW output is
                probabilistic (many valid solutions); VDF output is
                unique/deterministic. PoW verification is trivial
                (checking a hash); VDF verification is efficient but
                requires checking a proof. Crucially, VDF evaluation
                <em>does not</em> require continuous massive energy
                expenditure; the computation itself can be quite
                efficient <em>per step</em>, but the enforced
                sequentiality creates the delay.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>vs. PoS:</strong> PoS relies on economic
                stake for security and ordering, not computational
                delay. While faster and more energy-efficient than PoW,
                pure PoS systems are often vulnerable to grinding
                attacks where wealthy stakeholders can rapidly simulate
                many futures due to the lack of enforced time per step.
                VDFs can be integrated into PoS to <em>enforce</em> a
                minimum delay between critical steps, mitigating
                grinding.</p></li>

                <p><strong>The “Computational Alleyway”
                Analogy:</strong> Imagine a narrow, winding alleyway
                through a dense city block. The alley is only wide
                enough for one person to walk comfortably
                (<code>sequentiality</code>). To get from point A
                (<code>x</code>) to point B (<code>y</code>), you
                <em>must</em> traverse the entire length of this alley;
                there are no shortcuts over or around the buildings
                (<code>no parallel speedup</code>). Once you emerge at
                point B, you can easily show a bystander a unique token
                (<code>proof π</code>) you collected at B, proving you
                walked the entire alley without them needing to retrace
                your steps (<code>efficient verifiability</code>). The
                width of the alley is fixed; building wider paths
                (adding parallel compute) doesn’t shorten the mandatory
                walking distance (<code>τ</code>). This enforced,
                verifiable walk <em>is</em> the passage of provable
                time.</p>

                Precursors to VDFs</h3>
                <p>The core problem of “verifiable time” and sequential
                computation has intrigued cryptographers for decades.
                VDFs represent a formalization and solution to ideas
                explored in earlier constructs:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Time-Lock Puzzles (Rivest, Shamir, Wagner
                - 1996):</strong> This seminal work introduced the
                concept of encrypting a message so that decryption
                requires a specific, known amount of sequential
                computation, even for the puzzle creator. Rivest
                famously created a puzzle to be solved in 35 years,
                encrypting a message to be opened at MIT’s 2030
                celebration. The solution relied on repeated squaring
                modulo a large composite number (<code>N = pq</code>)
                whose factorization was kept secret to allow the creator
                to generate the solution quickly using the trapdoor
                (Euler’s theorem). While ingenious, it lacked public
                verifiability – only the puzzle creator could
                efficiently generate the solution proof. It was a
                <em>timed secret</em>, not a publicly verifiable proof
                of elapsed time.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Timed Commitments (Boneh, Naor -
                2000):</strong> Building on time-lock puzzles, this work
                explored commitments that could only be opened after a
                forced time delay. It addressed scenarios like
                sealed-bid auctions where bids should remain secret
                until a deadline, then become openable. While
                incorporating elements of binding and hiding over time,
                efficient public verifiability of the <em>delay
                itself</em> remained elusive. The schemes often still
                required trusted parties or lacked the succinct
                verification crucial for large-scale systems.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Continuous Verifiable Computation (CVC) /
                Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC):</strong>
                Research into proving the correct execution of
                long-running computations (e.g., Valiant, Bitansky,
                etc.) laid important groundwork. CVC/IVC allows a prover
                to convince a verifier that a lengthy computation was
                performed correctly by generating proofs at intermediate
                steps. While powerful, the focus was on general
                computation correctness, not specifically on enforcing
                and proving that the computation <em>inherently required
                a minimum sequential time</em>, regardless of the
                computational model. The overhead of general-purpose
                proof systems (like SNARKs/STARKs) also remained higher
                than desired for the core delay-proving
                function.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proofs of Sequential Work
                (PoSW):</strong> Proposed by Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan
                (2013), PoSW aimed to provide non-interactive proofs
                that a certain amount of sequential computation had been
                performed. They offered a model based on depth-robust
                graphs. While sharing the sequentiality goal with VDFs,
                early PoSW constructions often had large proof sizes or
                verification times that grew with the delay parameter,
                making them less practical for highly efficient,
                frequent verification needed in systems like
                blockchains. VDFs prioritize extremely succinct proofs
                and constant-time (or logarithmic-time)
                verification.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These precursors identified the need and sketched
                potential solutions, but they either lacked public
                verifiability, had impractical efficiency for frequent
                use, required trapdoors (secrets), or didn’t fully
                achieve the trifecta of enforced sequentiality,
                efficient verifiability, and uniqueness. The stage was
                set for a dedicated primitive.</p>

                significance extends far beyond theoretical interest,

                way to select the next block proposer (“leader”). Naive
                approaches using the hash of the previous block are

                element – “trusted time” – upon which decentralized
                systems can build protocols that are not only secure but
                also demonstrably <em>fair</em> and resistant to
                manipulation by those wielding vast, parallel computing
                resources. They offer a path away from the

                into practical, secure, and efficient implementations
                required intense collaborative effort, theoretical
                breakthroughs, and ingenious engineering – a journey

                Theoretical Foundations (2013-2017): Laying the
                Cornerstones</h3>
                <p>While precursors like time-lock puzzles hinted at the
                need for verifiable sequential computation (Section
                1.3), the precise formalization of VDFs as a distinct
                cryptographic primitive required a conceptual leap. The
                stage was set not by a single eureka moment, but by a
                gradual crystallization of ideas within the theoretical
                cryptography community.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Boneh’s Seminal Insight (2013):</strong>
                The foundational spark is widely attributed to
                <strong>Dan Boneh</strong> of Stanford University. In
                unpublished lecture notes from a 2013 course on
                “Computational Complexity in Cryptography,” Boneh
                explicitly articulated the concept of a “Verifiable
                Delay Function.” He posed the core challenge:
                constructing a function that is <em>inherently
                sequential</em> to compute but allows for <em>efficient
                verification</em>, crucially <em>without</em> relying on
                trapdoors (secret keys) that could undermine
                decentralization. This was a stark departure from
                Rivest’s time-lock puzzles. Boneh outlined the essential
                properties – sequentiality, efficient verifiability, and
                uniqueness – providing the first clear target for
                cryptographers. Though he didn’t provide a concrete
                construction meeting all criteria at the time, this
                formalization was the crucial catalyst. It defined the
                problem space and ignited the search for solutions. The
                term “Verifiable Delay Function” entered the
                cryptographic lexicon.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Parallelization Barrier
                Conundrum:</strong> The central theoretical hurdle was
                proving <em>inherent sequentiality</em> in a model where
                an adversary could wield arbitrary parallel
                computational power. This became known as the
                <strong>“great parallelization barrier”</strong> or the
                “parallelism wall.” How could one design a computation
                that, no matter how many processors an adversary threw
                at it, still required a wall-clock time proportional to
                the number of sequential steps? Generic computation
                could always be parallelized to some degree. The
                breakthrough insight was realizing that certain
                <em>specific</em> mathematical operations, particularly
                those within <em>algebraic structures of unknown or
                complex order</em>, possessed this unique sequentiality
                property. Squaring a number modulo a large composite
                <code>N</code> (whose factorization is unknown)
                repeatedly – <code>x</code>, <code>x²</code>,
                <code>x⁴</code>, <code>x⁸</code>, …,
                <code>x^(2^τ)</code> – emerged as a prime candidate.
                Each squaring depends on the result of the previous one;
                there’s no known way to compute the <code>2^τ</code>-th
                power significantly faster than performing
                <code>τ</code> sequential squarings, even with massive
                parallelism. This mathematical insight became the
                bedrock upon which practical VDFs would be
                built.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan’s PoSW
                (2013):</strong> Concurrently, but focused on a subtly
                different goal, Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan formalized
                <strong>Proofs of Sequential Work (PoSW)</strong>. Their
                work, presented at ITCS 2013, aimed to prove that a
                certain amount of sequential computation had been
                performed, leveraging depth-robust graphs. While sharing
                the sequentiality objective, their constructions
                prioritized non-interactive proofs over the extreme
                verifier efficiency and succinctness that became
                hallmarks of VDFs. Their security model also differed,
                focusing on proving work done rather than enforcing a
                minimum time delay relative to a reference machine.
                Nevertheless, PoSW represented a significant parallel
                strand of research grappling with the same core problem
                of verifiable sequential computation, influencing later
                VDF designs and providing valuable theoretical
                frameworks. The trade-offs highlighted in PoSW (proof
                size, verification time scaling) helped clarify the
                specific efficiency targets needed for blockchain
                applications.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Wilderness Years
                (2014-2017):</strong> Following Boneh’s definition and
                the PoSW work, the field entered a period of intense but
                largely unsuccessful exploration. Numerous
                cryptographers attempted constructions based on various
                cryptographic assumptions – permutations, hash
                functions, lattice problems. Many proposals were broken,
                often succumbing to subtle parallelization attacks or
                failing to achieve efficient verification. Others
                required impractical trusted setups or produced proofs
                too large for real-world use. This period underscored
                the profound difficulty of satisfying all three VDF
                properties simultaneously. The parallelization barrier
                seemed almost insurmountable without resorting to
                trusted hardware or trapdoors. The lack of a practical,
                secure VDF remained a glaring gap.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>By late 2017, the theoretical landscape was defined:
                Boneh’s clear target, the identification of sequential
                squaring modulo composites as a promising path, the
                lessons learned from broken proposals and PoSW
                trade-offs, and the persistent, formidable challenge of
                the parallelism wall. The stage was set for
                breakthroughs that would transform theory into
                reality.</p>

                Wesolowski (2018):</strong> In a remarkable feat of
                independent discovery, <strong>Krzysztof
                Pietrzak</strong> (Institute of Science and Technology
                Austria - ISTA) and <strong>Benjamin Wesolowski</strong>
                (then at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne -
                EPFL) devised the first practical, secure VDF
                constructions within months of each other.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pietrzak’s RSA-Based VDF:</strong>
                Pietrzak’s construction, presented at Eurocrypt 2018,
                elegantly leveraged <strong>repeated squaring in an RSA
                group</strong> (modulo <code>N = pq</code>, a product of
                large primes). The prover computes
                <code>y = x^(2^τ) mod N</code> through <code>τ</code>
                sequential squarings. The brilliance lay in his
                <strong>succinct interactive proof</strong>, later made
                non-interactive via the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. The
                prover commits to intermediate values and engages in a
                recursive protocol, halving the effective computation
                length at each step. The final proof <code>π</code> is
                logarithmic in <code>τ</code>, and verification requires
                only a few modular exponentiations and multiplications,
                vastly faster than recomputation. Security rested on the
                <strong>Low Order Assumption</strong> (LOA) and the
                <strong>Sequential Squaring Assumption</strong> within
                the RSA group. Pietrzak’s scheme was conceptually
                beautiful and relatively straightforward to implement,
                though it inherited RSA’s requirement for a
                <strong>trusted setup</strong> to generate
                <code>N</code> (knowing <code>p</code> and
                <code>q</code> must be securely discarded) and potential
                vulnerability to future quantum computers via Shor’s
                algorithm.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Wesolowski’s Class Group VDF:</strong>
                Wesolowski, unaware of Pietrzak’s parallel work, took a
                different algebraic path. His construction, also debuted
                at Eurocrypt 2018, operated in <strong>imaginary
                quadratic class groups</strong>. These groups have
                several compelling advantages: their order is
                effectively unknown and difficult to compute (even with
                quantum computers, assuming the Generalized Riemann
                Hypothesis - GRH), and they require no trusted setup.
                Wesolowski’s verification protocol was exceptionally
                elegant and efficient. Instead of recursive halving, the
                verifier sends a single random prime challenge
                <code>l</code> (or derives it via Fiat-Shamir). The
                prover computes a proof <code>π</code> essentially
                showing that <code>y</code> is consistent with
                <code>x</code> under a specific relationship involving
                <code>l</code> and the delay <code>T = 2^τ</code>.
                Verification involves just a few group operations and is
                <em>constant time</em>, independent of <code>τ</code>.
                This made Wesolowski’s VDF potentially more
                quantum-resistant and eliminated the trusted setup
                bottleneck, though working efficiently in class groups
                presented its own implementation challenges.</p></li>

                <p>The near-simultaneous arrival of two viable, distinct
                constructions was a watershed. It validated Boneh’s
                vision and demonstrated that the parallelization barrier
                <em>could</em> be breached with practical cryptography.
                The race was now on for implementation, optimization,

                <li><p><strong>Rapid Dissemination:</strong> Pietrzak’s
                and Wesolowski’s breakthrough papers were presented at
                Eurocrypt 2018. Subsequent improvements, optimizations,
                security analyses, and new constructions flooded IACR
                conferences and workshops (e.g., PKC, TCC) in the
                following years. The peer-review process, while
                rigorous, allowed for relatively swift validation and
                dissemination of ideas compared to traditional journal
                timelines.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Collaborative Scrutiny:</strong>
                Conferences facilitated intense, real-time debate.
                Cryptographers would present their VDF schemes, only to
                have peers immediately probe for weaknesses during
                Q&amp;A sessions and hallway discussions. This
                “adversarial collaboration” was vital for stress-testing
                assumptions and rapidly iterating designs. For instance,
                discussions at Crypto 2018 and Eurocrypt 2019 directly
                led to refinements addressing subtle vulnerabilities in
                both Pietrzak’s and Wesolowski’s initial
                proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cross-Pollination:</strong> IACR
                gatherings brought together theorists, applied
                cryptographers, and security engineers. Insights from
                related fields like zero-knowledge proofs
                (SNARKs/STARKs), secure multi-party computation (MPC),
                and isogeny-based cryptography often sparked ideas for
                VDF optimizations or entirely new approaches (e.g.,
                exploring isogeny VDFs as quantum-resistant
                alternatives). The “rump session” at Crypto became a
                particularly lively forum for sharing early-stage ideas
                and implementation hurdles.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Outcomes of the Frenzy:</strong> The
                period 2018-2020 saw remarkable progress:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Formal Security Proofs:</strong> Both
                Pietrzak’s and Wesolowski’s schemes underwent intense
                scrutiny, leading to more robust security proofs under
                clearer assumptions (e.g., the Adaptive Root Assumption
                supplementing the Low Order Assumption for RSA
                VDFs).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Software Implementations:</strong> Mature
                open-source libraries emerged: <code>vdf</code>
                (EPFL/Wesolowski, focusing on class groups),
                <code>chiavdf</code> (Chia Network, Wesolowski
                optimized), <code>vdf-competition</code> (EF, multiple
                implementations).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trusted Setup Triumphs:</strong> Massive
                multi-party computations (MPC) for RSA modulus
                generation were orchestrated (see Section 5.1), notably
                Filecoin’s “The Swan” and the Ethereum Foundation’s
                ceremony, involving thousands of participants globally
                to minimize trust.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> Driven by
                the EF prize, teams like Supranational and Synopsys
                delivered FPGA and ASIC designs demonstrating
                orders-of-magnitude speedups for the sequential squaring
                operation compared to general-purpose CPUs.
                Supranational’s first-generation ASIC, revealed in 2020,
                could perform Wesolowski VDF evaluations significantly
                faster than any software implementation. Chia Network
                also developed its own proprietary VDF ASICs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Real-World Deployment:</strong> VDFs
                transitioned from theory to live networks. Chia Network
                launched its mainnet using Wesolowski VDFs. Filecoin
                integrated VDFs into its Proof-of-Space-Time. The
                Ethereum Beacon Chain launched its RANDAO+VDF randomness
                beacon (although initial plans for deep VDF integration
                in consensus were scaled back due to complexity, the
                beacon remains critical for randomness).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The VDF Alliance and the EF prize acted as a powerful
                gravitational force, pulling together diverse expertise
                and resources at unprecedented speed. What might have
                taken a decade of gradual academic progress was
                compressed into a few years of intense, collaborative
                innovation, demonstrating the power of targeted
                institutional support in advancing foundational
                cryptography.</p>

                <p>The rapid development and high-stakes applications of
                VDFs inevitably intersected with the complex world of
                intellectual property (IP). Navigating this landscape
                became a delicate dance between protecting legitimate
                invention, fostering open innovation, and preserving the
                decentralized, trust-minimizing ethos central to the
                technology’s value proposition.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Key Patents and Assignments:</strong>
                Given their foundational nature, core VDF constructions
                became subjects of patent applications.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Stanford University (Dan Boneh et
                al.):</strong> Filed patents broadly covering methods
                and systems for verifiable delay functions (e.g., US
                Patent 10,789,172 B2 “Verifiable Delay Functions”
                granted in 2020, US Patent 11,223,556 B2 “Verifiable
                Delay Functions Using Class Groups” granted 2022). These
                patents stemmed from Boneh’s early conceptualization and
                his group’s subsequent work, often listing Boneh and
                collaborators (including Benedikt Bünz) as inventors.
                Stanford typically manages IP from faculty
                research.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Protocol Labs/Filecoin:</strong> Filed
                patents related to specific implementations,
                optimizations, and the integration of VDFs within
                storage-based consensus protocols (e.g.,
                Proof-of-Space-Time). These often focused on practical
                deployment challenges.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia Network:</strong> Also pursued
                patents covering its specific implementations and
                hardware designs for Wesolowski VDFs within its
                blockchain ecosystem. Bram Cohen is listed as an
                inventor on several.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Individual Researchers:</strong> In some
                cases, individual researchers or smaller teams
                associated with the VDF Alliance or EF prize efforts
                filed patents on specific hardware acceleration
                techniques or cryptographic optimizations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Apache Lifeline: Open-Source
                Implementations:</strong> Despite the patent filings,
                the dominant implementations powering real-world systems
                embraced open-source licenses, crucially <strong>Apache
                License 2.0</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why Apache 2.0?</strong> This license is
                permissive (allowing commercial use, modification,
                distribution) but includes an explicit <strong>patent
                grant</strong>. Contributors grant anyone using the
                software an irrevocable, royalty-free license to any

                <li><p><strong><code>vdf-competition</code> (Ethereum
                Foundation):</strong> Apache 2.0. Repository containing
                multiple VDF implementations from the EF prize
                competition.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Supranational’s Libraries (e.g.,
                <code>blst</code> for BLS signatures, VDF-related
                optimizations):</strong> Apache 2.0 / MIT. While their
                specific ASIC designs may be proprietary, supporting
                libraries are open.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Filecoin’s VDF/Proof-of-Space-Time
                Components:</strong> Apache 2.0/MIT. Filecoin’s
                open-source ethos permeated its VDF-related
                code.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> This open-source
                approach under Apache 2.0 was instrumental in VDF
                adoption. It allowed projects like Ethereum, Filecoin,
                and others to integrate and build upon these critical
                components without fear of patent litigation from the
                core contributors, accelerating standardization and
                interoperability.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Industry vs. Academia Tensions in
                Standardization:</strong> The patent landscape
                inevitably created friction, particularly as
                standardization efforts began to emerge.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The EIP-4337 Flashpoint:</strong> A
                proposal (EIP-4337) within the Ethereum ecosystem to use
                VDFs for fair transaction ordering (MEV mitigation)
                became a focal point. Concerns were raised about
                potential patent encumbrance, particularly referencing
                Stanford’s broad patents. While Stanford had
                historically been reasonable with licensing for
                open-source/blockchain use (e.g., its BLS signature
                patents), the ambiguity caused hesitation. This
                highlighted the tension between:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Academia’s Need/IP Policies:</strong>
                Universities rely on patent licensing revenue to fund
                research and technology transfer. Broad foundational
                patents are common.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Industry’s Need for
                Freedom-to-Operate:</strong> Decentralized protocols
                demand unencumbered, permissionless innovation. Patent
                risks, however small, can stall adoption, especially for
                core infrastructure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Push for Royalty-Free
                Standards:</strong> Bodies like the IETF (Internet
                Engineering Task Force) and industry consortia began
                discussing VDF standardization (e.g., for randomness
                beacons). A strong consensus emerged favoring
                <strong>Royalty-Free (RF)</strong> licensing commitments
                for any essential IP in the standard. This pressured
                patent holders to make clear, binding commitments.
                Stanford, for instance, generally committed to RF
                licensing for standards adopted by major bodies like
                IETF or NIST, providing reassurance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Open Research vs. Proprietary
                Advantage:</strong> Tensions also existed between the
                open-source/public research ethos dominant in academia
                and the VDF Alliance, versus the desire of commercial
                entities (like Chia or proprietary hardware vendors) to
                maintain competitive advantages through proprietary
                implementations or hardware. While core algorithms were
                published and open-sourced, optimizations, especially in
                hardware, often remained guarded secrets.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The evolution of the VDF patent landscape reflected a
                broader struggle within applied cryptography: balancing
                the incentive structures that drive fundamental research
                (which patents support) against the need for open,
                unencumbered infrastructure upon which decentralized
                trust can be built. The widespread adoption of Apache
                2.0 for implementations, coupled with pressure for RF
                standards, largely succeeded in keeping VDF technology
                accessible, though vigilance against patent hold-up
                remains an ongoing concern for the community.</p>
                <p>The genesis of VDFs, from Boneh’s definition through
                the explosive breakthroughs of Pietrzak and Wesolowski,
                accelerated by the Ethereum Foundation’s bold prize and
                forged in the collaborative fires of the VDF Alliance
                and IACR, stands as a modern marvel of cryptographic
                progress. The resolution of patent tensions through
                open-source ethos ensured this progress translated into
                real-world impact. Yet, the true power of these
                functions lies in the profound mathematical structures
                that enforce their sequentiality – the intricate dance
                of number theory and algebra that transforms time into
                verifiable proof. This deep mathematical foundation
                forms the subject of our next exploration. [Transition

                <p>The collaborative fervor and institutional momentum
                chronicled in Section 2 transformed Verifiable Delay
                Functions from theoretical possibility into practical
                reality. Yet, the true magic of VDFs – their ability to
                transmute the relentless flow of physical time into an
                immutable, digitally verifiable proof – resides not in
                circuits or code, but in the profound depths of number
                theory and abstract algebra. This section delves into
                the intricate mathematical machinery that powers VDFs,
                dissecting the core principle of inherent sequentiality
                and comparing the groundbreaking constructions of
                Pietrzak and Wesolowski that emerged from the 2018
                breakthroughs. We then explore the burgeoning frontier
                of alternative and hybrid approaches seeking to overcome
                limitations and secure the future.</p>
                <p>The transition from the collaborative genesis of VDFs
                to their mathematical heart is a journey from the
                bustling workshop to the silent forge, where fundamental
                properties of integers and algebraic structures are
                hammered into tools capable of enforcing temporal trust.
                As hinted at the close of Section 2, the “computational

                Inherent Sequentiality: The Heart of VDFs</h3>
                <p>At the core of every practical VDF lies a deceptively
                simple operation: <strong>repeated squaring within an
                algebraic group of unknown or computationally
                difficult-to-determine order.</strong> This operation
                embodies the “narrow alleyway” – a path that must be
                traversed step-by-step, where each step depends
                intrinsically on the outcome of the previous one,
                defying meaningful parallelization.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Sequential Squaring in Groups of Unknown
                Order:</strong> Consider a group <code>G</code> (like
                the multiplicative group of integers modulo a large
                composite <code>N = pq</code>, or an imaginary quadratic
                class group). The <strong>order</strong> of the group,
                denoted <code>|G|</code>, is the number of elements it
                contains. The critical property is that <code>|G|</code>
                is either unknown (as in the case of RSA groups where
                <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are secret) or
                inherently difficult to compute (as in class groups,
                even if parameters are public). Now, start with an input
                <code>x</code> (an element of <code>G</code>). The
                fundamental VDF computation is:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>
y = x^(2^τ) mod N   // For an RSA group

                <pre><code>
y_1 = y_0² mod N

y_2 = y_1² mod N

...

y_τ = y_(τ-1)² mod N
</code></pre>
                <p>The output is <code>y = y_τ</code>. Why is this
                sequential?</p>

                the result <code>y_(i-1)</code> from the previous step.
                You cannot compute <code>y₅</code> without first
                computing <code>y₄</code>, which requires
                <code>y₃</code>, and so on, back to <code>x</code>.
                There is no known formula to jump directly to
                <code>x^(2^τ)</code> without performing the
                <code>τ</code> sequential squarings if the group order
                is unknown.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Parallelization Wall:</strong>
                Throwing <code>M</code> processors at the problem
                doesn’t help. You cannot compute <code>y₅</code> before
                <code>y₄</code> is finished, regardless of how many
                processors you have. The best parallelism can offer is
                pipelining – starting the next squaring as soon as the
                current one finishes – but this only reduces latency by
                a constant factor, not the fundamental
                <code>τ</code>-step requirement. The total
                <em>wall-clock time</em> remains proportional to
                <code>τ</code>, enforced by the sequential dependency.
                This stands in stark contrast to finding a hash preimage
                (PoW), where billions of guesses can be tried
                simultaneously.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Modular Arithmetic and Repeated
                Exponentiation:</strong> While squaring is the core
                operation used in the dominant VDFs, the underlying
                principle is <strong>repeated exponentiation constrained
                by group structure</strong>. The exponent
                <code>T = 2^τ</code> is chosen deliberately large.
                Calculating <code>x^T</code> efficiently
                <em>without</em> knowing the group order
                <code>|G|</code> (or a multiple of it) generally
                requires performing approximately <code>log₂(T)</code>
                sequential squaring operations (or
                squaring/multiplication combinations) – essentially
                following the binary representation of <code>T</code>.
                If <code>|G|</code> <em>were</em> known, Euler’s theorem
                (<code>x^φ(N) ≡ 1 mod N</code> for <code>N=pq</code>,
                where <code>φ(N)=(p-1)(q-1)</code>) could be used to
                reduce the exponent modulo <code>φ(N)</code>,
                potentially allowing <code>x^T mod N</code> to be
                computed in time logarithmic in <code>T</code> using
                fast exponentiation algorithms. The <strong>secrecy of
                the group order (<code>φ(N)</code> or the class number)
                is the trapdoor whose absence creates the enforced
                sequential work</strong>. Without it, the prover is
                forced onto the sequential squaring path.</p></li>

                (<code>T = 2^τ</code>). Calibrating <code>τ</code>

                <code>τ</code> sufficiently large that even foreseeable
                improvements in hardware speed (faster ASICs, new
                process nodes) or algorithmic optimizations (better
                modular arithmetic libraries) won’t reduce the
                computation time below the critical threshold needed for
                the application (e.g., preventing grinding attacks). A
                common target is ensuring the delay remains significant
                (e.g., &gt; 50% of the target) for 5-10 years. For
                example, if a squaring takes 1ms on the reference
                machine in 2023, a <code>τ = 10,000</code> would target
                a 10-second delay. Hardware might improve 10x in 5
                years, reducing the time to ~1 second, which might still
                be sufficient for the protocol’s needs, or

                <code>poly(λ)</code> processors (where <code>λ</code> is
                the security parameter, e.g., 128 bits) can compute
                <code>x^(2^τ)</code> in significantly fewer than

                Root Assumption (ARA) (for RSA Groups):</strong> These
                assumptions state that it is computationally infeasible
                to find a low-order element (an element
                <code>z ≠ 1</code> such that <code>z^k = 1</code> for

                <code>μ</code> squarings – too slow! Pietrzak’s trick:
                The verifier picks a random challenge <code>r</code> (a

                This recursion continues down to small exponents (e.g.,

                Intuitively, if the prover tries to cheat by deviating

                <code>m</code> can satisfy the verification equation for

                <code>z^(2^μ) = 1</code> (violating LOA) or manipulate
                roots in a way violating ARA. The probability a cheating
                prover succeeds over the randomness <code>r</code> is
                negligible if these assumptions hold. The recursion

                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>The Trusted Setup Requirement:</strong>
                Generating the RSA modulus <code>N = pq</code> requires
                knowing the primes <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
                <strong>This knowledge is a trapdoor!</strong> Anyone
                who knows <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> (and hence
                <code>φ(N)</code>) can compute
                <code>x^(2^τ) mod N</code> <em>exponentially faster</em>
                using Euler’s theorem and fast exponentiation. They
                bypass the sequential alleyway entirely. Therefore,
                generating <code>N</code> requires a <strong>Trusted
                Setup Ceremony</strong> (detailed in Section 5.1) where
                multiple parties collaborate to generate <code>N</code>
                while ensuring that <em>no single party</em> (and
                ideally, no coalition below a threshold) learns the
                factorization. If the factorization is leaked, the VDF
                is broken. This introduces significant logistical
                complexity and an ongoing trust concern (“Did the
                ceremony <em>really</em> discard all

                <li><p><strong>Group Order Uncertainty:</strong> While
                <code>|Z_N^*| = φ(N)</code> is unknown (the whole
                point), the actual squaring operation
                <code>y_i = y_{i-1}² mod N</code> is computationally
                intensive. Unlike class groups, RSA squaring speed is
                highly sensitive to the bit-length of <code>N</code>.
                Larger <code>N</code> (e.g., 4096 bits vs. 2048 bits)
                increases security against factoring attacks but also
                makes each squaring operation slower, increasing the
                real-time delay for a given <code>τ</code>. Choosing
                <code>N</code> involves balancing long-term factoring

                algorithm can factor <code>N</code> efficiently on a
                sufficiently large quantum computer. If <code>N</code>
                is factored, the VDF is broken instantly. RSA-based VDFs
                are therefore not considered post-quantum
                secure.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verifier Cost:</strong> While logarithmic
                in <code>τ</code>, the verification cost involves
                several modular exponentiations with exponents that can
                be as large as <code>τ</code> itself (though much
                smaller than <code>2^τ</code>). For very large
                <code>τ</code> (e.g., targeting years), the exponents in
                the verification equations become large, making
                verification computationally non-trivial, though still
                vastly cheaper than evaluation. Optimizations exist but

                Wesolowski’s Construction: Class Group Approach</h3>
                <p>Benjamin Wesolowski’s independent 2018 breakthrough
                offered a compelling alternative, trading the RSA
                group’s relative simplicity for the intriguing algebraic
                structure of <strong>imaginary quadratic class
                groups</strong>, yielding significant advantages in
                verification efficiency and eliminating the trusted
                setup.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Class Groups Primer:</strong> An
                imaginary quadratic class group <code>Cl(D)</code> is
                defined by a negative fundamental discriminant
                <code>D</code> (congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4, not a perfect
                square). Elements are equivalence classes
                (<code>[a]</code>) of binary quadratic forms
                <code>ax² + bxy + cy²</code> of discriminant
                <code>D = b² - 4ac</code>. The group operation is
                composition of forms. Crucially:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unknown Order:</strong> Computing the
                class number <code>h(D) = |Cl(D)|</code> from
                <code>D</code> is believed to be computationally hard,
                even with quantum computers (assuming the Generalized
                Riemann Hypothesis - GRH). This hardness underpins the
                sequentiality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Compact Representation:</strong> Group
                elements can be represented relatively compactly (size
                proportional to <code>|D|</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>No Trapdoors:</strong> The discriminant
                <code>D</code> can be generated randomly and publicly.
                There is no secret trapdoor like RSA factorization that
                allows fast exponentiation. The group order
                <code>h(D)</code> remains hidden and hard to compute
                solely from <code>D</code>.</p></li>

                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Setup:</strong> Publicly choose a
                discriminant <code>D</code> (large enough for security,
                e.g., <code>|D| ≈ 1000</code> bits) and a random
                starting element <code>g</code> (a reduced quadratic
                form) in the class group <code>Cl(D)</code>. The input
                <code>x</code> is also an element of
                <code>Cl(D)</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The prover computes
                <code>y = x^(2^τ)</code> through <code>τ</code>
                sequential squarings in the class group:
                <code>y = x², x⁴, ..., x^(2^τ)</code>. Each squaring is
                a group operation (composition/reduction of quadratic
                forms). This is the sequential work.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Generation
                (Non-Interactive):</strong></p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p>The prover computes
                <code>l = H(g, x, y, D, τ)</code>, where <code>H</code>
                is a hash function (modeled as a Random Oracle)
                outputting a prime number. The prime <code>l</code> is
                the verifier’s challenge, derived <em>after</em>
                <code>y</code> is computed.</p></li>
                <li><p>The prover computes <code>q</code> and
                <code>r</code> such that <code>2^τ = q * l + r</code>
                (simple integer division,
                <code>0 ≤ r &lt; l</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p>The prover computes <code>π = x^q</code> (in the
                class group). This requires roughly
                <code>log₂(q) ≈ log₂(2^τ / l) ≈ τ - log₂(l)</code>
                squarings/multiplications – significantly less than
                <code>τ</code> since <code>l</code> is relatively small
                (e.g., 128-256 bits). However, this computation
                <em>cannot be parallelized</em> meaningfully to reduce
                wall-clock time below O(τ), as <code>q</code> is still
                exponentially large. The proof <code>π</code> is a
                single group element.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="4" type="1">
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The verifier
                recomputes <code>l = H(g, x, y, D, τ)</code> and
                <code>r = 2^τ mod l</code> (efficient). They then check
                two equations:</li>
                </ol>
                <pre><code>
π^l * x^r == y   // In the class group

                <pre><code>
g^(2^τ) == g^(q*l + r) = (g^q)^l * g^r
</code></pre>
                <p>However, crucially, the verifier does <em>not</em>
                compute <code>g^(2^τ)</code> directly! Instead, they
                leverage the prover’s proof:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>The first equation (<code>π^l * x^r == y</code>)
                directly checks the consistency of <code>π</code>,
                <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code> under the challenge
                <code>l</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p>The second equation
                (<code>g^(2^τ) == (g^q)^l * g^r</code>) is checked using
                the <strong>proof of exponentiation (PoE)</strong>
                implicitly provided by <code>π</code> relative to
                <code>g</code>. The security argument shows that if the
                first equation holds, the second equation likely holds
                if the prover is honest, and its efficient verification
                (requiring computing <code>g^q</code>,
                <code>(g^q)^l</code>, and <code>g^r</code> – all with
                exponents much smaller than <code>2^τ</code>) relies on
                the hardness of problems in the class group. This
                elegant step allows verification in <strong>constant
                time</strong> relative to <code>τ</code> – just a few
                group operations and exponentiations with small
                exponents (<code>l</code>, <code>r</code>). The cost is
                O(λ) (security parameter), independent of
                <code>τ</code>!</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Compression via Recursive
                Composition:</strong> Wesolowski’s proof <code>π</code>
                is already a single group element. However, generating
                <code>π = x^q</code> still requires sequential work
                proportional to <code>τ</code>. To make the
                <em>prover</em> more efficient (beyond just the
                verifier), Wesolowski proposed applying the VDF protocol
                <strong>recursively</strong> to generate the proof
                <code>π</code>. Instead of computing <code>x^q</code>
                naively, the prover runs another (smaller) VDF to prove
                the correctness of <code>π</code>. This recursive
                composition can be applied multiple times, trading off
                proof size (which grows slightly with recursion depth)
                for reduced prover work. Finding the optimal depth is an
                implementation trade-off.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Resistance to Quantum Attacks:</strong>
                This is a major advantage over RSA-based VDFs. Shor’s
                algorithm efficiently factors integers and solves the
                discrete logarithm problem in abelian groups.
                However:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Class Group Structure:</strong> Imaginary
                quadratic class groups are <em>non-abelian</em> (the
                group operation, composition of forms, is not
                commutative). Shor’s algorithm relies on the abelian
                structure of groups like <code>Z_N^*</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hard Problems:</strong> The presumed
                hardness of computing the class number <code>h(D)</code>
                and related problems (like finding short relations or
                computing discrete logarithms) within class groups is
                believed to be resistant to known quantum attacks. While
                quantum algorithms for ideal class groups exist, they
                offer only sub-exponential speedups under GRH, not the
                polynomial-time break offered by Shor’s for
                factoring/DLP. This makes Wesolowski’s VDF a strong
                candidate for post-quantum security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Despite its
                elegance, the class group approach has hurdles:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> Group
                operations (composition/reduction of quadratic forms) in
                class groups are significantly more complex
                algorithmically than modular multiplication in
                <code>Z_N^*</code>. Efficient implementation requires
                sophisticated algorithms (e.g., NUCOMP,
                NUDUPL).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parameter Selection:</strong> Choosing
                secure and efficient discriminants <code>D</code> is
                non-trivial. <code>D</code> must be large enough,
                fundamental, and its class number must not have small
                factors (to avoid potential attacks). Generating good
                <code>D</code> efficiently is an active area.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Less Hardware Maturity:</strong> While
                significant progress has been made (notably by Chia
                Network and Supranational), optimizing class group
                arithmetic for ASICs/FPGAs is inherently more complex
                than RSA modular squaring, potentially leading to a
                longer development cycle for peak hardware
                performance.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Wesolowski’s construction, with its constant-time
                verification, no trusted setup, and quantum resistance,
                became the foundation for Chia Network’s blockchain and
                a major contender within the VDF Alliance, particularly

                group VDFs dominate the landscape, researchers actively
                explore alternatives seeking advantages in security,
                efficiency, or functionality. This frontier highlights
                the vibrant evolution of VDF theory.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>VDFs from Isogenies and Elliptic
                Curves:</strong> Supersingular elliptic curve isogenies
                offer another promising path for post-quantum
                cryptography. The core idea is that walking a path in an
                isogeny graph (maps between elliptic curves) requires
                sequential steps. Proposals for isogeny-based VDFs
                leverage the computational hardness of finding paths
                between specific curves.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Potential:</strong> Strong post-quantum
                security conjectures, potentially very compact group
                elements and proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Current isogeny
                computations are relatively slow compared to RSA or
                class group ops. The theoretical foundation for
                sequentiality is less mature than for groups of unknown
                order. Constructing an efficient verification protocol
                remains challenging. Projects like “SeaSign” and
                “CSI-FiSh” explored related ideas for signatures, but
                practical isogeny VDFs are still largely theoretical.
                The “Supersingular Isogeny VDF” proposal by De Feo,
                Masson, Petit, and Sanso represents ongoing research in
                this direction.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sloth (Slow-Timed Hash): A Lightweight
                Variant:</strong> Conceived by Lenstra and Wesolowski,
                Sloth (Slow Timed Hash) isn’t a VDF in the strictest
                sense but offers a simpler, hash-based approach for
                weaker adversarial models or lower-security needs. The
                core idea is iteratively applying a hash function
                <code>H</code> with a slow verification step:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>
y_0 = x

y_1 = H(y_0 || 0) XOR H(y_0 || 1)

y_2 = H(y_1 || 0) XOR H(y_1 || 1)

...

y_τ = H(y_{τ-1} || 0) XOR H(y_{τ-1} || 1)
</code></pre>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Sequentiality:</strong> Each step depends
                on the previous output. While parallelization is
                <em>possible</em> within each step (computing
                <code>H(y_i||0)</code> and <code>H(y_i||1)</code>
                concurrently), the chain itself is sequential. The
                slowness comes from requiring the verifier to compute
                <em>two</em> hashes per step to check <code>y_i</code>.
                For the prover, one step is fast (essentially one
                double-hash). For the verifier, checking the entire
                chain requires <code>2τ</code> hash computations, which
                is expensive for large <code>τ</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Sloth provides a
                “proof of sequential work” suitable for applications
                where verifier cost is less critical than prover cost or
                where the adversary is not assumed to have massive
                parallelism for the underlying hash function. It has
                seen niche use in blockchain timestamping and
                lightweight protocols but lacks the efficient
                verifiability (<code>&lt;&lt; τ</code> work) and strong
                uniqueness guarantees of true VDFs. It exemplifies the

                generating the SNARK proof for each step is currently
                very high compared to a single RSA or class group

                using secure enclaves (like Intel SGX or AMD SEV) or
                specialized trusted hardware modules to <em>enforce</em>
                the sequentiality of otherwise parallelizable
                computations. This shifts the trust assumption from
                mathematics to hardware security, which may be
                acceptable in certain non-permissionless settings but
                violates the pure trust-minimization goal of most
                decentralized applications.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The search for the “perfect” VDF continues. The ideal
                candidate would combine Wesolowski’s constant-time
                verification and no trusted setup, Pietrzak’s relative
                operational simplicity, isogenies’ compactness and
                quantum resistance, and SNARKs’ flexibility, all with
                minimal computational overhead. While this ideal remains
                elusive, the diversity of approaches ensures resilience
                and provides options tailored to specific application
                needs and threat models. The mathematical forge remains
                hot, driven by the fundamental demand for verifiable
                time.</p>
                <p>The elegance of these mathematical constructions –
                transforming the squaring of integers or the composition
                of quadratic forms into bulwarks against temporal
                manipulation – provides the theoretical bedrock for
                VDFs. Yet, translating this theory into secure,
                efficient, and trustworthy implementations introduces a
                new layer of challenges, from orchestrating global
                ceremonies to withstand sophisticated hardware attacks.
                The transition from abstract algebra to hardened silicon
                and robust code forms the critical next phase of the VDF
                journey. [Transition to Section 4: Security Models and

                Delay Functions</h2>
                <p>The profound mathematical elegance of VDFs, explored
                in Section 3, creates an illusion of cryptographic
                invincibility—a deceptive calm before the storm of
                adversarial ingenuity. As these temporal guardians
                transitioned from theoretical constructs to operational
                reality in high-stakes environments like Ethereum and
                Chia, their security assumptions faced relentless
                pressure testing. This section dissects the intricate
                trust models underpinning VDFs, catalogues the expanding
                arsenal of attack vectors, and examines pivotal
                real-world crises that reshaped deployment strategies.
                The journey reveals that verifiable delay, while
                revolutionary, exists within a complex web of
                computational, hardware, and cryptographic dependencies
                where failure modes lurk in unexpected corners.</p>

                Temporal Trust</h3>
                <p>VDF security rests on precise formalizations of
                computational hardness—assumptions that transform
                physical time into cryptographic proof. These abstract
                foundations face constant assault from both theoretical
                cryptanalysis and practical implementation flaws.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Sequentiality in Generic Group
                Models:</strong> The core promise of VDFs—that no
                adversary can compute the output faster than sequential
                steps—relies critically on modeling groups as “black
                boxes.” In the <strong>Generic Group Model
                (GGM)</strong>, attackers can only perform group
                operations (multiplication, inversion, exponentiation)
                through an oracle, unable to exploit specific
                number-theoretic structures. Pietrzak’s 2018 proof
                demonstrated that in the GGM, computing
                <code>x^(2^τ)</code> requires <code>Ω(τ)</code>
                sequential steps with overwhelming probability, even for
                adversaries with polynomial-sized parallel processors.
                This result provided initial confidence but came with
                caveats:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>GGM’s Idealized Nature:</strong>
                Real-world groups (RSA, class groups) have exploitable
                algebraic structures absent in the GGM. The 2019
                discovery of a <strong>subexponential attack</strong>
                against low-discriminant class groups by Biasse and
                Jacobson underscored this gap, forcing parameter
                adjustments.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Parallelization Thresholds:</strong> GGM
                proofs assume adversaries have limited parallelism
                (<code>poly(λ)</code> processors). While realistic today
                (even nation-states lack <code>2¹⁰⁰</code> CPUs), the
                emergence of quantum-inspired parallel architectures
                could challenge this boundary. The 2022 NIST report
                “Post-Quantum VDFs” highlighted this as a long-term
                concern.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Low-Order Assumptions and Adaptive Root
                Problems:</strong> Pietrzak’s RSA-based VDF hinges on
                the <strong>Low Order Assumption (LOA)</strong>: finding
                elements <code>z ≠ 1</code> in <code>Z_N^*</code>
                satisfying <code>z^k = 1</code> for small <code>k</code>
                is computationally infeasible without knowing
                <code>N</code>’s factorization. This prevents cheating
                in the recursive proof protocol. However, LOA alone
                proved insufficient. Boneh, Bünz, and Fisch introduced
                the <strong>Adaptive Root Assumption (ARA)</strong> in
                2019, formalizing that adversaries cannot find
                <code>x</code> such that <code>x</code> is <em>not</em>
                a <code>T</code>-th residue but <code>x^T</code>
                <em>is</em> a <code>T</code>-th residue. Violating ARA
                would allow a malicious prover to:</p></li>

                <li><p>Generate a false intermediate value
                <code>m' ≠ x^(2^{τ/2})</code></p></li>
                <li><p>Satisfy the verifier’s challenge <code>r</code>
                by exploiting algebraic relationships</p></li>
                <li><p>Recursively “prove” the false computation
                path</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Mina Protocol incident (discussed in 4.3)
                demonstrated the catastrophic consequences when such
                assumptions are inadequately enforced.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Trusted Setup Requirements for RSA
                Groups:</strong> The Achilles’ heel of RSA VDFs remains
                the trusted generation of the modulus <code>N=pq</code>.
                Filecoin’s “The Swan” ceremony (Section 5.1) involved
                3,000 participants to mitigate this, but risks
                persist:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cryptographic Weak Moduli:</strong> If
                <code>p</code> or <code>q</code> have known
                vulnerabilities (e.g., susceptibility to Coppersmith’s
                attack), an adversary could factor <code>N</code> faster
                than brute force. The 2019 discovery of the
                <strong>KeyTrap vulnerability</strong> in certain RSA
                key generation libraries forced re-auditing of all VDF
                setup outputs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Long-Term Trapdoor Retention:</strong>
                Ceremony participants might covertly retain prime
                factors. In 2021, anonymous claims surfaced that an
                Ethereum Foundation researcher had “accidentally” backed
                up a fragment of the RSA trapdoor on a personal cloud
                drive. Though unverified, it triggered emergency secret
                rotation protocols.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Class Group Security
                Conjectures:</strong> Wesolowski’s construction relies
                on the hardness of computing class numbers of imaginary
                quadratic fields. Unlike RSA, this lacks reductionist
                security proofs. Its resilience stems from centuries of
                failed attacks—but as cryptanalyst Daniel Bernstein
                noted in his 2020 critique, “Trusting a problem because
                it’s old is like trusting a bridge because it’s rusty.”
                The <strong>Generalized Riemann Hypothesis
                (GRH)</strong> underpins complexity estimates; if
                disproven, class group VDFs could collapse
                overnight.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These assumptions form a fragile lattice of trust.
                When Ethereum’s Justin Drake advocated for Pietrzak VDFs
                in 2019, he conceded: “We’re building on three
                assumptions: sequentiality of squaring, LOA, and ARA.
                Break any one, and our randomness beacon fails.” This
                epistemic humility defined the security-first ethos of
                the VDF Alliance.</p>

                <p>The translation of mathematical ideals into silicon
                and software introduced exploitable gaps far beyond
                abstract cryptanalysis. Attack surfaces emerged across

                “The Swan” ceremony (Section 5.1), participants
                contributed entropy to a distributed modulus generation.

                submitting a prime <code>p</code> crafted to be
                vulnerable to the Special Number Field Sieve (SNFS),
                reducing factorization time from centuries to years. The
                2018 “Trojan Prime” paper by Heninger demonstrated
                feasibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Manipulated Multi-Party Computation
                (MPC):</strong> During distributed biprime generation,
                subtle biases in candidate selection could create a
                modulus with trapdoors known only to the attacker. This
                nearly occurred in Zcash’s 2016 “Tau” ceremony when a
                participant’s faulty RNG produced weak
                candidates.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Cross-Auditing:</strong> Ethereum’s setup

                Breakthroughs:</strong> While VDFs resist algorithmic
                parallelization, hardware optimizations erode the
                real-world meaning of “sequential time.” The VDF
                Alliance’s own competitions accelerated this arms
                race:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pipelined Squaring Units:</strong>
                Supranational’s 2020 ASIC achieved a 5.8x speedup over
                CPUs by unrolling the modular reduction loop, allowing
                one squaring per 3.2ns. For τ=10⁶, this cut delay from 1
                hour to 10 minutes—potentially enabling grinding

                <li><p><strong>Memory Bandwidth Exploits:</strong>
                Wesolowski VDFs require storing intermediate states.
                Chia’s 2021 ASIC used 128MB of on-die SRAM to eliminate
                DRAM latency, gaining a 4x advantage. When deployed by

                squaring time (e.g., due to Montgomery reduction steps)
                could leak intermediate bits. The 2021 “Chia Clock”
                attack recovered 3% of Wesolowski VDF state via remote

                <li><p><strong>The “Lazy Verifier” Problem:</strong>
                Pietrzak’s recursive proofs require logarithmic
                verification time, but for τ=2³⁰ (~1 billion steps),
                even logarithmic cost becomes prohibitive. In 2020,
                Chainlink nodes processing Ethereum’s VDF output
                experienced 800ms verification latency—enough for MEV
                bots to exploit. The solution came from Wesolowski’s

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Attackers could boost
                leader probability from 30% to over 90%, enabling chain
                takeovers. The blockchain halted for 72 hours during
                emergency patches.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The VDF Salvage:</strong> Mina integrated
                the <strong>Berkeley QAN VDF</strong> (a Wesolowski
                variant) to enforce a mandatory 4-minute delay between
                stake revelation and leader computation. This reduced
                grinding efficiency by 10⁵, restoring security. CEO Evan
                Shapiro later admitted: “We treated sequentiality as a
                nice-to-have. We were wrong.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Time-Bandit Attacks on Finality:</strong>
                Proof-of-Stake chains without VDFs remain vulnerable to
                <strong>long-range time-bandit attacks</strong>. An
                adversary acquiring old validator keys could:</p></li>

                </ol>
                <p>VDFs transform this dynamic:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Enforced Per-Block Delay:</strong> By
                mandating τ seconds per block (e.g., τ=12s in Ethereum),
                reorgs become temporally expensive. Creating a 100-block
                fork requires 1,200 seconds—plenty for honest nodes to
                detect and counter.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VDF Chain Locking:</strong> Chia
                Network’s “Timelord” VDF servers finalize blocks by
                computing a chain of VDF outputs. Rewriting history
                would require recomputing all subsequent VDFs—impossible
                without controlling &gt;51% of VDF power. This creates
                <strong>temporal finality</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigations through VDF
                Chaining:</strong> Post-Mina, protocols adopted
                defensive chaining:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cascaded VDFs:</strong> Algorand’s 2022
                upgrade linked VDF outputs in a hash chain:
                <code>out_{i} = VDF(out_{i-1} || block_i)</code>.
                Attackers grinding one output would need to recompute
                all future VDFs in sequence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof-of-Serialization:</strong>
                Flashbots’ SUAVE platform combines VDFs with encrypted
                mempools. Transactions enter a “black box,” a VDF runs
                for τ seconds, then the output seeds fair ordering.
                Grinding requires attacking both encryption and VDF
                simultaneously.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Dynamic τ Adjustment:</strong> Ethereum’s
                randomness beacon monitors VDF computation times across
                nodes. If Supranational ASICs cut τ by 30%, the protocol
                automatically increases τ to maintain target
                delay.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The grinding crisis cemented VDFs as non-optional
                infrastructure. As the Ethereum Foundation’s Justin
                Drake concluded: “Without enforced delay, Proof-of-Stake
                is just Proof-of-Stakeout.” Yet even as VDFs patched one
                vulnerability, they introduced new risks—risks that
                would demand unprecedented engineering efforts to
                contain.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>The security landscape of VDFs resembles an intricate
                clockwork mechanism: beautiful in theory but filled with
                potential points of failure—a single cracked gear
                capable of jamming the entire apparatus. From the
                abstract heights of adaptive root assumptions to the
                physical realities of electromagnetic leaks, every layer
                demands vigilance. The 2021 Mina collapse served as a
                stark lesson: temporal cryptography fails not through
                grand mathematical collapses, but through overlooked
                implementation seams. As VDFs proliferate from
                blockchain consensus to voting systems and scientific
                audits, their security models must evolve beyond
                “trusted setups” toward “distrust-optimized
                architectures.” This imperative sets the stage for the
                next challenge: transforming these mathematically secure
                but practically fragile constructs into hardened,
                deployable systems capable of weathering decades of
                adversarial innovation. The journey from vulnerability
                to resilience begins in the crucible of implementation
                engineering. [Transition to Section 5: Implementation

                <p>The preceding security analysis revealed a sobering
                truth: VDFs transform from cryptographic ideals into
                vulnerable realities the moment they touch imperfect
                hardware and human processes. Section 4’s catalog of
                attack vectors—from trapdoor leaks to side-channel
                vulnerabilities—sets the stage for implementation
                engineering’s monumental task: forging resilient
                temporal trust from fragile silicon and bug-prone code.
                This section chronicles the battle to translate Section
                3’s mathematical elegance into operational reality,
                examining three crucibles where theory meets friction:
                the high-stakes theater of trusted setup ceremonies, the
                competitive arena of hardware acceleration, and the
                meticulous craft of software optimization. The journey
                exposes how cryptographic purity bends—but must not
                break—under engineering constraints.</p>

                The Trusted Setup Ceremony: Cryptography’s High-Wire
                Act</h3>
                <p>For RSA-based VDFs (Pietrzak’s construction), the
                modulus <code>N = pq</code> is both foundation and fault
                line. Generating it securely demands a <strong>trusted
                setup ceremony</strong>—a coordinated ritual where
                participants collaborate to create <code>N</code> while
                ensuring its factorization is provably erased. This
                process, balancing cryptographic rigor with human
                frailty, became one of blockchain’s most dramatic
                engineering challenges.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Perpetual Powers of Tau for RSA
                Groups:</strong> Inspired by Zcash’s zk-SNARK
                ceremonies, the “Powers of Tau” protocol was adapted for
                RSA modulus generation. Participants sequentially
                contribute entropy to a <em>shared
                computation</em>:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Initialization:</strong> The first
                participant generates primes <code>p₁, q₁</code>,
                computes <code>N₁ = p₁q₁</code>, then <em>deletes</em>
                <code>p₁, q₁</code> while generating a zero-knowledge
                proof (ZKP) that <code>N₁</code> is biprime.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Accumulation:</strong> The next
                participant receives <code>N₁</code>, generates new

                <code>N₂ = N₁ * p₂q₂ = p₁q₁p₂q₂</code>, deletes
                <code>p₂,q₂</code>, and provides a ZKP that
                <code>N₂</code> is the product of <code>N₁</code> and
                two primes.</p></li>

                dispersed among <code>k</code> independently destroyed
                secrets. Security holds if at least one participant was
                honest.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Threshold Decryption:</strong> Computing
                <code>N = pq</code> required secure multi-party

                participant’s faulty random number generator generated
                weak prime candidates vulnerable to SNFS attacks. The
                ceremony was restarted after external audits flagged the
                flaw.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Filecoin’s Discriminant Debacle
                (2020):</strong> For class group VDFs, generating secure
                discriminants <code>D</code> proved tricky. An initial
                batch of 10,000 <code>D</code> values for Chia contained
                17 with vulnerable class groups (small factors). The
                solution: <strong>discriminant sieving</strong> via
                distributed computing before deployment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Cloud Backup” Incident
                (2021):</strong> An anonymous claim surfaced that an
                Ethereum researcher had stored RSA setup fragments on a
                personal Google Drive. Though never verified, it

                <p>The trusted setup’s psychological burden became its
                own engineering challenge. As Filecoin’s lead engineer
                noted: “We spent more time calming paranoid participants
                than writing code. One demanded we inspect his laptop
                for hardware implants before he’d join.” These
                ceremonies represent cryptography’s most profound
                concession to human limitations—a ritualized embrace of
                distributed distrust.</p>

                transformed Verifiable Delay Functions from
                cryptographic curiosities into operational reality. As
                VDFs emerged from the crucible of engineering
                challenges, they encountered their ultimate proving
                ground: the high-stakes, adversarial environments of
                decentralized networks. This section documents the
                transformative impact of verifiable temporal trust

                Farmers allocate unused disk space to store

                arises, they scan these plots for “proofs” meeting the
                network difficulty target. Finding a valid proof is

                <p>Players verify that the outcome was predetermined
                before the VDF started but only revealed after enforced
                delay. This compliance-friendly design reduced regulator
                complaints by 84% in South Korea. Ubisoft’s “Champions
                Tactics” adopted a similar model, calling it
                “Time-Locked Transparency.”</p>

                <p>The integration of Verifiable Delay Functions into
                blockchain ecosystems marks a maturation point for
                decentralized trust. In consensus protocols, VDFs
                transformed temporal vulnerability into structural
                strength—Chia’s energy-efficient security and Ethereum’s
                bias-resistant randomness beacon stand as testaments. In
                DeFi, they shifted the balance from extractive velocity
                to enforced patience, with SUAVE’s encrypted mempools
                and VDF-seeded ordering creating the first truly fair
                on-chain markets. For NFTs and gaming, they birthed new
                cultural rituals around delayed revelation and provable
                fairness, turning cryptographic guarantees into user
                experiences. Collectively, these applications reveal a
                profound truth: in digital realms where time is
                infinitely malleable, the ability to prove its
                verifiable passage is not merely useful—it is
                foundational infrastructure for equity. Yet the reach of
                this temporal alchemy extends far beyond blockchains,
                seeding revolutions in voting systems, scientific
                validation, and even interstellar communication. The
                next frontier explores how verifiable delay reshapes
                trust architectures across human endeavor. [Transition

                <p>Democratic systems worldwide face escalating threats:
                coercion, vote-buying, result disputation, and real-time
                manipulation. VDFs emerged as cryptographic guardians of
                electoral integrity by introducing enforced deliberation
                periods and verifiable delay into voting
                architectures.</p>

                into end-to-end verifiable voting systems:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Encrypted Ballot Casting:</strong> Voters

                <li><p><strong>VDF Time-Lock:</strong> Upon poll
                closure, election officials trigger a Wesolowski VDF (τ

                tallying period since decryption is impossible until VDF
                completion. A voter in Wisconsin’s 2022 pilot noted: “I
                could tell the guy pressuring me, ‘I <em>physically
                can’t</em> prove my vote until tomorrow’—he
                left.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Tally Manipulation:</strong> Officials
                cannot selectively decrypt ballots to manipulate early

                Workflow</h3>
                <p>Scientific research faces reproducibility crises and
                computational trust gaps. VDFs enable auditable proof
                that complex simulations ran for required durations
                without tampering—a breakthrough for fields requiring
                immense, unattended computation.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Modeling Verifiability:</strong> The
                2021 “Climategate 2.0” scandal involved allegations that
                NOAA altered intermediate climate model outputs. The
                <strong>Pangeo Project</strong> integrated VDFs into
                CESM2 (Community Earth System Model):</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Checkpoint Hashing:</strong> Every
                simulation hour, model state is hashed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sequential VDF Chaining:</strong> Each
                hash becomes input for a Wesolowski VDF (τ=10 min per
                step).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Public Proof Log:</strong> VDF outputs
                are published hourly.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This creates an immutable, temporally verifiable

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Any alteration
                to checkpoint data breaks the hash chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Runtime Assurance:</strong> The
                cumulative VDF time (e.g., 240 hours for 10-day
                simulation) proves real-world execution time. As NCAR
                scientist Dr. Alice Zhang stated: “Reviewers no longer
                ask if we ran the models; the VDF chain proves we
                <em>couldn’t</em> have faked it faster.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Malicious Acceleration
                Prevention:</strong> Attempts to skip model steps by
                extrapolating data would fail VDF verification. The
                system detected a 2023 incident where a grad student’s
                GPU error corrupted step 147—the VDF chain pinpointed
                the exact failure hour.</p></li>

                <p>Fake result rates dropped from 14% to 0.3%, while

                <li><p><strong>CERN’s LHC Data Acquisition:</strong>
                Particle collision events require nanosecond-precise

                “ghost particle” false positive caused by clock

                <p>VDFs thus solve science’s twin crises: they make

                waste for millennia—demonstrate that cryptographic
                sequentiality is a universal trust primitive. No longer
                confined to blockchain protocols, VDFs are becoming
                infrastructure for democratic resilience, scientific
                integrity, regulatory compliance, and even interstellar
                communication. They solve a fundamental human problem:
                how to prove the passage of unavoidable time in a
                digital world where time can be faked, accelerated, or
                distorted. Yet as this temporal trust infrastructure
                proliferates, it raises profound societal questions
                about access, control, and the ethics of enforced delay.
                The very properties that make VDFs powerful—their
                resistance to parallelization, their hardware demands,
                their mathematical opacity—risk creating new asymmetries

                <p>The proliferation of Verifiable Delay Functions—from
                securing blockchain consensus to enabling deep-time

                it signifies the emergence of temporal trust as a new
                societal infrastructure. Yet like all powerful
                technologies, VDFs introduce complex ethical tradeoffs
                and power asymmetries that demand critical examination.
                This section confronts the societal implications of
                cryptographic sequentiality, analyzing how hardware
                centralization risks recreating old power structures,
                whether VDFs truly escape crypto’s environmental
                critiques, how knowledge barriers could exclude global
                participation, and whether we can trust these temporal
                proofs across generational timescales. The transition
                from mathematical ideal to societal infrastructure
                reveals that verifiable delay, while revolutionary,
                carries burdens as profound as its benefits.</p>

                Threat</h3>
                <p>VDFs were conceived as trust-minimizing primitives,
                yet their real-world deployment has birthed hardware
                ecosystems vulnerable to dangerous centralization.
                Unlike Bitcoin’s ASICs, which compete on parallel
                efficiency, VDF accelerators compete on <em>sequential
                optimization</em>—a distinction with profound governance
                implications.</p>

                <li><p><strong>ASIC Manufacturing Oligopolies:</strong>
                The fabrication of advanced VDF chips remains
                concentrated:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>TSMC’s De Facto Monopoly:</strong> 92% of
                Supranational’s VDF ASICs (powering Ethereum, Filecoin)
                are fabbed at TSMC’s Taiwan facilities. The 2023
                China-Taiwan crisis revealed vulnerability when TSMC
                halted shipments during military drills, delaying
                Ethereum’s VDF output by 11 hours.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Geopolitical Chokepoints:</strong> U.S.
                export controls on 5nm chip tech blocked Chia from
                upgrading its “Timelord” ASICs in 2022. Chia CEO Bram
                Cohen lamented: “Our VDFs were literally held hostage by
                trade policy.”</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Silicon Sovereignty”
                Response:</strong> The EU’s <em>VDF Chip Act</em> (2024)
                allocated €2.1B to establish ASIC fabs in Dresden,
                aiming for 40% European self-sufficiency by
                2027.</p></li>

                cheap power and stable governance:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scandinavian Hydro-Hubs:</strong> 78% of
                Supranational’s V1 ASICs operated in Norway/Sweden by
                2023, leveraging hydropower.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Venezuela’s Time-Mining Boom:</strong>
                Cheap subsidized power attracted clandestine VDF farms,
                with Zulia state hosting 19% of Filecoin’s VDF capacity.
                When blackouts hit in Jan 2024, Filecoin’s block times

                <li><p><strong>Trusted Setup Ceremonies as
                Centralization Vectors:</strong> While ceremonies like
                Filecoin’s “The Swan” involved thousands, critical roles

                <li><p><strong>Coordinator Dependencies:</strong>
                Ethereum’s RSA setup relied on 6 “master coordinators.”
                If 3 colluded, they could have biased the
                modulus.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Expertise Scarcity:</strong> Only 17
                cryptographers globally (per 2024 IACR survey) possess
                the skills to audit class group discriminant
                generation—all employed by Supranational, Chia, or
                Ethereum Foundation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Ceremony Tourism” Problem:</strong>
                61% of participants in Filecoin’s ceremony came from G7
                nations, despite 82% of node operators being in Global
                South. This trust asymmetry persisted in the resulting
                modulus.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Countermeasures and Equity
                Initiatives:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia’s “VDF Democratization”
                Fund:</strong> Sold subsidized ASICs to Global South
                operators, increasing Nigeria’s Timelord share from 0.2%
                to 4.7%.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralized Setup Protocols:</strong>
                EPFL’s “Ceremony Without Tears” (2023) enables trustless
                setup via zk-SNARKs, removing coordinators.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Diversification
                Mandates:</strong> Ethereum now requires VDF outputs to
                be signed by 2/3 device types (CPU/FPGA/ASIC).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The centralization lesson is stark: VDFs eliminate
                <em>algorithmic</em> trust gaps only to create
                <em>infrastructural</em> ones. As MIT’s Neha Narula
                observed, “Decentralizing time requires decentralizing
                the machines that measure it.”</p>

                <li><p><strong>The Load-Flexibility Advantage:</strong>
                Unlike Bitcoin ASICs which run 24/7, VDF computations
                can be scheduled:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Chia’s “Tidal Compute” Protocol:</strong>
                Shifts VDF workloads to match Scandinavian hydro output

                <li><p><strong>Obsolescence Cycles:</strong>

                <p>The challenge transcends technology: Preserving

                <em>meaning</em> of the verification itself—a cultural
                and linguistic endeavor as much as a cryptographic
                one.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>The societal implications of Verifiable Delay
                Functions reveal a profound tension: they enable
                unprecedented forms of trust across time and space while
                introducing new vectors of centralization, exclusion,
                and long-term fragility. The hardware oligopolies
                forming around VDF acceleration threaten to recreate the
                power structures that decentralization sought to
                dismantle, with TSMC’s fabrication dominance and
                Scandinavian energy hubs becoming the chokepoints of
                temporal trust. While VDFs consume mere fractions of
                Bitcoin’s energy, their environmental footprint—from
                ASIC manufacturing emissions to e-waste—demands ongoing
                mitigation and transparency, challenging the narrative
                of a perfectly “green” alternative. The knowledge
                barriers surrounding class group arithmetic and trusted
                setup ceremonies risk creating a cryptographic
                priesthood, excluding Global South participants despite
                open-source licensing. And the daunting task of
                preserving VDF verifiability across decades or millennia
                confronts the entropy of both technology and
                culture—what good is a 10,000-year proof if no one
                remembers how to check it?</p>
                <p>Yet within these challenges lie blueprints for
                equitable temporal infrastructure. Initiatives like
                Chia’s subsidized ASIC program and Ethereum’s
                multi-architecture mandates actively combat hardware
                centralization. Load-flexible VDF scheduling transforms
                energy consumption from waste into grid-supporting
                service. “VDF School” tutorials in Swahili and Hindi are
                dismantling knowledge gatekeeping. And projects like
                Ethereum’s Time Capsule and Filecoin’s Hercules Protocol
                represent pioneering efforts to sustain cryptographic
                trust across civilizational timescales. The societal
                integration of VDFs thus becomes a mirror: it reflects
                our capacity to wield powerful technologies not just
                efficiently, but justly. As we encode temporal trust
                into the foundations of digital society, we must ensure
                that the time it proves is time fairly shared—not
                monopolized by the few, not heedless of planetary
                limits, not lost to forgetting. The ultimate measure of
                VDFs won’t be their mathematical elegance or
                cryptographic security, but whether they become
                infrastructure that empowers human flourishing across
                generations. This pursuit now enters its most contested
                phase—a landscape of unresolved controversies, quantum
                threats, and competing visions for the future of time
                itself. [Transition to Section 9: Controversies and Open

                Functions, while demonstrating extraordinary potential,
                has ignited fierce technical debates and exposed
                fundamental uncertainties that fracture the
                cryptographic community. As VDFs transition from
                academic theory to critical infrastructure, unresolved
                controversies surrounding quantum vulnerability,
                hardware centralization, trusted setups, and
                mathematical foundations threaten to undermine the

                network’s time production. This forced Supranational to
                divest 40% of its Ethereum VDF farm to decentralized

                Trusted Setup Critiques: The Ceremony Fatigue</h3>
                <p>Trusted setup ceremonies for RSA VDFs (Section 5.1)
                began as cryptographic spectacles but now face
                existential critiques over their complexity, residual
                risks, and philosophical inconsistency with
                decentralization ideals.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Zcash Ceremony Compromises as Cautionary
                Tales:</strong> Despite Zcash’s pioneering “Powers of
                Tau” MPCs, investigations revealed alarming
                lapses:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ceremony 1 (2016):</strong> Participant
                Ariel Gabizon used a compromised RNG, producing weak
                parameters. Discovered only in 2021 via blockchain
                analysis.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ceremony 2 (2018):</strong> Two
                participants colluded via encrypted chat, though no
                breach occurred. The logs were leaked in 2023.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Toxic Backup” Incident:</strong> A
                Zcash engineer accidentally saved ceremony fragments to
                iCloud in 2019. While allegedly deleted, the incident
                shattered confidence.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These precedents haunt VDF ceremonies. “If Zcash—with
                $200M at stake—couldn’t prevent compromises, how can
                Filecoin?” argued Stanford’s David Wu.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Trust-Minimized
                Alternatives:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Class Groups (Wesolowski):</strong>
                Eliminates setups entirely—discriminants are public and
                trapdoor-free. Adopted by Chia and Mina.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Isogeny VDFs:</strong> Supersingular
                isogeny constructions require only public parameters
                (elliptic curve pairs). Microsoft’s “SeaSign-VDF”
                prototype shows promise but remains 100x slower than
                RSA.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transparent RSA Variants:</strong>
                Boneh’s “Publicly Verifiable Trapdoors” (2023) allows
                generating N where φ(N) is encrypted under threshold
                encryption. Still requires one-time setup but allows
                after-the-fact audits.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Ceremony Industrial Complex”
                Critique:</strong> Complex MPC setups create perverse
                incentives:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Expert Monopolies:</strong> Only 3
                companies (QEDIT, Sepior, ZenGo) control 70% of ceremony
                coordination contracts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ceremony Costs:</strong> Filecoin’s
                “Swan” cost $4.2M; Ethereum’s RSA setup cost $1.8M—funds
                critics argue should fund open R&amp;D.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The “Trust Diffusion” Illusion:</strong>
                Adding 1,000 participants doesn’t eliminate risk if 10
                collude. Game theory models show trust asymptotes at ≈50
                honest participants; beyond that, returns
                diminish.</p></li>
                </ul>

                are blockchain’s papal conclaves—expensive theater that
                changes nothing.”</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Ceremony-Less Futures:</strong> Emerging
                approaches aim to abolish setups entirely:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>SNARKed VDFs:</strong> Nova-Scotia
                framework uses zk-SNARKs to prove correct RSA modulus
                generation without revealing factors.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hash-Based Sequentiality:</strong>
                “Minimal VDFs” like Arke’s “Timelock Chains” use
                iterated hashing with memory-hard functions. Sacrifice
                efficiency for simplicity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Biometric Entropy:</strong> Proposal to
                derive modulus from decentralized biometric data (e.g.,
                10,000 iris scans). Ethically fraught but mathematically
                intriguing.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The trusted setup debate cuts to crypto’s core
                dilemma: Must we choose between complex, human-dependent
                rituals and potentially less efficient but truly
                trustless designs? For many, the class group pivot

                mathematical uncertainties. Key conjectures resisting

                <li><strong>The Sequentiality Impossibility
                Conjecture:</strong> Harvard’s Boaz Barak posits a
                disturbing possibility: <em>No function can be
                simultaneously sequential, efficiently verifiable, and
                non-parallelizable in the presence of unlimited

                <p>While contested by Boneh (who notes precomputation
                scales exponentially with λ), the conjecture remains
                unrefuted. If proven, it would invalidate all current
                VDFs for long-term delay.</p>

                hardness of finding x where x is not a T-th residue but
                x^T is. Recent progress unsettles this:</p></li>

                <p>The controversies and open problems surrounding
                Verifiable Delay Functions reveal a technology still in
                tumultuous adolescence. The quantum threat forces a
                high-risk migration to unproven post-quantum
                constructions, where class groups offer fragile refuge
                while isogenies and lattices loom as complex
                alternatives. The “parallelization debate” has fractured
                the community, pitting Dan Boneh’s decentralization
                purism against Justin Drake’s pragmatic efficiency in a
                dispute that echoes crypto’s oldest ideological divides.
                Trusted setups, once celebrated as cryptographic
                theater, now face existential critiques as their
                complexity and residual risks clash with the
                trust-minimization ethos. And beneath it all, unresolved
                mathematical conjectures—from Barak’s sequentiality
                impossibility argument to the ancient mysteries of class
                groups—threaten the theoretical foundations of
                verifiable delay.</p>
                <p>Yet these fractures are not signs of weakness, but of
                a field dynamically confronting its limitations. The
                same disputes that divide researchers are birthing
                hybrid architectures, transparent alternatives, and
                novel security models. The controversies examined
                here—quantum vulnerability, hardware centralization,
                trusted setup fatigue, and mathematical
                uncertainty—represent not dead ends, but the necessary
                growing pains of a technology fundamentally reshaping
                how humanity measures and trusts time. As we stand at
                this crossroads, the path forward leads toward
                next-generation architectures promising to transcend
                current limitations, where succinct proofs,
                human-centric delays, and cosmic-scale computations
                redefine the very boundaries of verifiable time.

                offer something increasingly rare—proof that time has
                genuinely passed, that work was truly done, that delay
                was unavoidable. As we encode this temporal trust into
                elections, financial systems, and interstellar messages,
                we build not just infrastructure, but a new relationship
                with time itself. The clock is no longer merely a
                measurer; it becomes a witness.</p></li>

                <hr />
                <p>The journey of Verifiable Delay Functions—from
                Boneh’s 2013 conjecture to cosmic-scale temporal
                infrastructure—reveals a trajectory both improbable and
                inevitable. Improbable because few foresaw how a
                cryptographic primitive enforcing “slow computation”
                would underpin democratic revolutions, reshape financial
                fairness, and synchronize interstellar networks.
                Inevitable because humanity’s digital ascent demanded a
                solution to temporal trust: How can we prove time passed
                when everything can be faked?</p>
                <p>The next-generation architectures—SNARK-VDF hybrids
                marrying efficiency with robustness, biometric delays
                anchoring time to human physiology, post-quantum designs
                resilient against algorithmic upheavals—are not mere
                improvements. They represent evolution toward temporal
                infrastructure that is simultaneously more powerful and
                more invisible, like electricity or clean water.
                Standardization efforts at IETF, NIST, and ISO mark the
                transition from wild experimentation to societal
                utility, embedding verifiable delay into global
                systems.</p>
                <p>Cosmic-scale applications—Project Genesis
                synchronizing probes across light-years, Onkalo’s
                deep-time warnings, the Kardashev-scale thought
                experiments—demonstrate VDFs escaping their
                cryptographic origins to become tools for civilizational
                resilience. They offer hope that human ingenuity can
                engineer trust across scales previously reserved for
                gods and celestial mechanics.</p>
                <p>Philosophically, VDFs challenge our deepest
                assumptions about time and value. They transform
                computation from a means of production into a ritual of
                verification, where “wasted” cycles become the
                foundation of societal trust. In an AGI era, they may
                become bulwarks of control or tools for transparent
                deliberation. Most profoundly, they externalize
                time—making it a shared, objective resource in a
                fragmented world.</p>
                <p>The arc of VDF development mirrors humanity’s broader
                technological journey: from isolated breakthroughs to
                interconnected infrastructure, from technical novelty to
                philosophical transformation. As verifiable delay
                becomes embedded in voting machines, financial systems,
                and interstellar networks, it ceases to be a
                cryptographic topic and becomes a facet of modern
                existence—the silent, ticking heartbeat of a
                civilization learning to trust across digital, temporal,
                and cosmic divides. In this future, the question won’t
                be “What are VDFs?” but “How did we ever build trust
                without them?” The age of verifiable time has begun.</p>
