                1: Conceptual Foundations and Genesis of ZK-EVMs</h2>
                <p>The relentless growth of the Ethereum blockchain,
                fueled by the explosive rise of decentralized finance
                (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and innovative
                decentralized applications (dApps), exposed a
                fundamental constraint: its inherent inability to scale
                transaction throughput while preserving decentralization
                and security. By 2020-2021, periods of peak demand
                transformed Ethereum into a digital toll road during
                rush hour, with users engaging in fierce bidding wars,
                driving gas fees to astronomical levels – sometimes
                exceeding $200 for a simple token swap. This “gas
                crisis” wasn’t merely an inconvenience; it threatened
                Ethereum’s core promise as a global, accessible
                settlement layer and platform for open innovation. The
                quest for scalability became existential, leading the
                ecosystem down a path that would culminate in one of its
                most technically ambitious and transformative endeavors:
                the Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine,
                specifically the Type-2 ZK-EVM. This section delves into
                the genesis of this groundbreaking technology, tracing
                its conceptual roots from the stark realities of
                Ethereum’s scaling imperative through the cryptographic
                marvels of zero-knowledge proofs, the pragmatic
                evolution of ZK-Rollups, and finally, the rigorous
                classification system that defines the Type-2 ZK-EVM’s
                unique promise of near-perfect Ethereum equivalence.</p>
                <h3
                id="the-ethereum-scaling-imperative-and-the-scalability-trilemma">1.1
                The Ethereum Scaling Imperative and the Scalability
                Trilemma</h3>
                <p>Ethereum’s foundational design, prioritizing
                decentralization and security through global state
                replication and proof-of-work (later proof-of-stake)
                consensus, inherently limited its transaction processing
                capacity. The network could typically handle only 10-30
                transactions per second (TPS), a stark contrast to
                centralized payment processors handling tens of
                thousands. As adoption surged, this bottleneck
                manifested in cripplingly high transaction fees and
                unpredictable confirmation times. The DeFi Summer of
                2020 and the subsequent NFT boom of 2021 served as
                stark, real-world stress tests. Users routinely paid
                more in gas fees than the value of the assets they were
                swapping; NFT mints became high-stakes gas auctions; and
                complex DeFi strategies became prohibitively expensive
                for all but the largest players. This wasn’t just a user
                experience issue; it stifled innovation, excluded
                smaller participants, and risked driving activity
                towards centralized alternatives or competing chains –
                undermining Ethereum’s core value proposition.</p>
                <p>This challenge is elegantly (and frustratingly)
                framed by the <strong>Scalability Trilemma</strong>, a
                concept popularized within the blockchain space by
                Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The trilemma posits
                that a blockchain system can realistically optimize for
                only two out of the following three properties at any
                given time:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The system
                operates without reliance on a small set of powerful,
                trusted entities. Anyone can participate in validation
                (running a node) with relatively modest hardware,
                ensuring censorship resistance and permissionless
                access.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> The system is highly
                resistant to attacks (e.g., 51% attacks, double-spends,
                state corruption), typically quantified by the enormous
                cost required to compromise it.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system can
                handle a high throughput of transactions and data (high
                TPS) without exponentially increasing costs or
                confirmation times as usage grows.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ethereum Layer 1 (L1), in its pursuit of robust
                decentralization and security, inherently sacrificed
                scalability. Increasing the block size or reducing block
                time – common scaling tactics – would lower the barrier
                for running a node, centralizing the network into the
                hands of fewer, more powerful entities, thus weakening
                decentralization. Sharding, a complex protocol upgrade
                to partition the network state and processing, offered a
                long-term L1 scaling path but proved enormously complex
                and years away from full realization.</p>
                <p>The pragmatic solution emerged in the form of
                <strong>Layer 2 (L2) Scaling Solutions</strong>. These
                protocols operate <em>on top</em> of Ethereum L1,
                leveraging its security as an anchor, while executing
                transactions off-chain. The core idea is to batch or
                process many transactions away from the congested and
                expensive L1, then periodically post compressed proofs
                or summaries <em>back</em> to L1 for final settlement
                and dispute resolution. Several L2 approaches
                emerged:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>State Channels (e.g., early Lightning
                Network concepts):</strong> Enable off-chain
                transactions between specific participants, only
                settling the final state on-chain. Efficient for
                specific, high-frequency interactions (e.g.,
                micropayments between two parties) but limited in
                general applicability.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Plasma:</strong> Proposed by Buterin and
                Joseph Poon, Plasma chains are separate blockchains
                anchored to Ethereum, periodically committing compressed
                state roots. While promising, complexities in securely
                exiting funds during disputes (“mass exit” problems) and
                data availability challenges hindered widespread
                adoption.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Rollups:</strong> Emerged as the dominant
                L2 scaling paradigm. Rollups execute transactions
                off-chain, bundle (“roll up”) hundreds or thousands into
                a single batch, and post this compressed transaction
                data <em>plus</em> a cryptographic proof of correct
                execution (or a commitment allowing fraud challenges) to
                Ethereum L1. Crucially, the <em>data</em> required to
                reconstruct the L2 state must be available on L1 (Data
                Availability - DA). Rollups come in two primary
                flavors:</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Optimistic Rollups (ORUs):</em> (e.g.,
                Optimism, Arbitrum) Assume transactions are valid by
                default (optimism) but include a fraud-proof window
                (typically 7 days) during which anyone can challenge an
                invalid state transition by submitting a fraud proof.
                Offers good compatibility but introduces withdrawal
                delays and relies on honest actors monitoring the
                chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Rollups
                (ZK-Rollups):</strong> (e.g., Loopring, zkSync 1.0,
                StarkEx) Generate a cryptographic proof (a ZK-SNARK or
                ZK-STARK) <em>attesting to the validity</em> of all
                transactions in the batch <em>before</em> posting the
                batch and proof to L1. Validity is verified instantly by
                an Ethereum smart contract. This eliminates the need for
                a fraud window, enabling near-instant finality for
                withdrawals and stronger security guarantees under a
                broader range of assumptions.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The shift towards ZK-Rollups marked a critical step,
                but early implementations faced a significant hurdle:
                they were largely application-specific or limited to
                simple token transfers. The holy grail – scaling
                <em>general-purpose</em> Ethereum smart contracts with
                their immense complexity – remained elusive. This set
                the stage for the conceptual leap towards the
                ZK-EVM.</p>

                Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Cryptographic Bedrock</h3>
                <p>The “ZK” in ZK-Rollup and ZK-EVM stands for
                Zero-Knowledge, a revolutionary concept in cryptography
                that underpins the entire security model. A
                <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</strong> allows one
                party (the Prover) to convince another party (the
                Verifier) that a specific statement is true <em>without
                revealing any information beyond the truth of the
                statement itself</em>. This seemingly paradoxical
                concept was formally introduced in a landmark 1985 paper
                by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff
                (“The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof
                Systems”). They established the theoretical foundation,
                defining the core properties a ZKP must satisfy:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Completeness:</strong> If the statement
                is true, an honest Prover can convince an honest
                Verifier of this fact.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Soundness:</strong> If the statement is
                false, no dishonest Prover (even with unlimited
                computational power) can convince an honest Verifier
                that it is true, except with negligible probability.
                This is the bedrock security guarantee.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> The Verifier
                learns <em>nothing</em> about the statement’s content
                beyond its truthfulness. The proof reveals no details
                about the inputs or the computational path
                taken.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Early ZKPs were <em>interactive</em>, requiring
                multiple rounds of challenge-and-response communication
                between Prover and Verifier. The 1986
                <strong>Fiat-Shamir heuristic</strong>, developed by
                Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir, provided a transformative
                breakthrough: it showed how to convert these interactive
                protocols into <em>non-interactive</em> Zero-Knowledge
                Proofs (NIZKs). By replacing the Verifier’s random
                challenges with the output of a cryptographic hash
                function (modeled as a Random Oracle), the Prover could
                generate a single, self-contained proof that anyone
                could later verify without further interaction. This
                made ZKPs practical for blockchain applications, where
                asynchronous verification is essential.</p>
                <p>The journey towards practical ZKPs for complex
                computation involved several key innovations:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Pinocchio Protocol (2013):</strong>
                Developed by Bryan Parno, Craig Gentry, Jon Howell, and
                Mariana Raykova, Pinocchio was a landmark Succinct
                Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (SNARK). It
                demonstrated that complex computations could be
                represented as Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAPs),
                allowing the generation of very small, constant-sized
                proofs (a few hundred bytes) that could be verified
                extremely quickly (milliseconds), even for large
                computations. However, it required a complex, one-time
                “Trusted Setup” ceremony to generate public parameters.
                Pinocchio formed the basis for <strong>ZCash</strong>
                (2016), the first practical application of ZK-SNARKs to
                enable shielded (private) cryptocurrency
                transactions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bulletproofs (2017):</strong> Introduced
                by Benedikt Bünz, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew
                Poelstra, Pieter Wuille, and Greg Maxwell, Bulletproofs
                were efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs
                <em>without a trusted setup</em>, primarily optimized
                for range proofs (e.g., proving a number is within a
                certain range without revealing it). While more
                efficient than some predecessors for specific tasks,
                their proof size and verification time scaled linearly
                with the complexity of the statement, making them less
                ideal for proving massive computation like entire
                blockchain blocks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of
                Knowledge - 2018):</strong> Developed by Eli Ben-Sasson,
                Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horesh, and Michael Riabzev at
                StarkWare, STARKs represented another major leap. They
                leveraged polynomial commitments and hash-based
                cryptography (resistant to quantum computers) and
                crucially, required <strong>no trusted setup</strong>
                (transparent). Proof size and verification time scale
                <em>quasilinearly</em> (roughly O(n log n)) with
                computation size, making them scalable for very large
                computations. However, proofs were initially larger and
                verification computationally more intensive than
                SNARKs.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This led to the primary dichotomy in modern ZK
                proving systems:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive
                ARguments of Knowledge):</strong> Characterized by very
                small proof sizes (constant or logarithmic in the
                computation size) and extremely fast verification times.
                The trade-off is the requirement for a <strong>trusted
                setup ceremony</strong> (per circuit or universal) to
                generate critical public parameters. If the ceremony’s
                “toxic waste” is compromised, false proofs could
                potentially be generated. Mitigations involve complex
                Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ceremonies (like the
                perpetual Powers of Tau) with many participants,
                minimizing trust. Popular modern SNARK constructions
                include Groth16, Plonk, Marlin, and Halo/Halo2, each
                optimizing different aspects (setup type, proof size,
                recursion).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ZK-STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments
                of Knowledge):</strong> Offer transparency (no trusted
                setup) and post-quantum security based on hash
                functions. Proof sizes and verification times are
                generally larger than SNARKs but scale more efficiently
                for massive computations. STARKs are particularly
                well-suited for recursive proof composition.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The choice between SNARKs and STARKs involves nuanced
                trade-offs: trusted setup risk vs. proof
                size/verification cost, quantum resistance timelines,
                and the specific computational workload. For the
                monumental task of proving general-purpose Ethereum
                execution (the ZK-EVM), both families and their hybrids
                would play crucial roles, demanding constant innovation
                to balance efficiency, security, and
                decentralization.</p>

                From ZK-Rollups to ZK-EVMs: The Evolution</h3>
                <p>Early ZK-Rollups (c. 2018-2020) were groundbreaking
                but inherently limited. Projects like
                <strong>Loopring</strong> (launched Dec 2019) and
                <strong>zkSync 1.0</strong> (launched mainnet June 2020)
                demonstrated the power of ZKPs for scaling specific
                functionalities:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Application-Specific Circuits:</strong>
                These rollups employed custom-built ZK circuits designed
                to prove the validity of <em>particular types</em> of
                transactions, primarily token transfers and simple
                swaps. A circuit is a program expressed in the language
                of arithmetic operations over a finite field, the format
                a ZKP system understands. Building a circuit for a fixed
                set of operations (e.g., “deduct X tokens from Alice,
                add X tokens to Bob”) is relatively manageable.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Efficiency Gains:</strong> By focusing on
                narrow use cases, these rollups achieved impressive
                scalability, high TPS, and minimal withdrawal times,
                showcasing the core ZK-Rollup advantage over Optimistic
                Rollups for their target applications.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, these limitations were stark:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Lack of EVM Compatibility:</strong>
                Developers could not deploy <em>arbitrary, existing
                Ethereum smart contracts</em> written in Solidity or
                Vyper. Porting a complex DeFi protocol like Uniswap or
                Aave was impossible because the underlying ZK circuits
                simply couldn’t represent or prove the execution of the
                diverse and complex opcodes of the Ethereum Virtual
                Machine (EVM).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fragmented Ecosystem:</strong> Each
                application-specific rollup created its own isolated
                environment. Users needed separate wallets, bridges, and
                liquidity pools for each one, fracturing the
                composability – the seamless interaction between smart
                contracts – that was a hallmark of Ethereum L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>High Development Barrier:</strong>
                Building new applications required deep ZK expertise to
                design and implement custom circuits, a scarce and
                specialized skill set. This stifled innovation and
                limited the scope of applications possible on
                ZK-Rollups.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The <strong>ZK-EVM Vision</strong> emerged as the
                ambitious solution: a ZK-Rollup capable of natively
                executing <em>any</em> standard Ethereum smart contract
                bytecode <em>and</em> generating a ZK proof attesting
                that this execution was performed correctly according to
                the EVM’s rules. Instead of building circuits for
                specific applications, the goal was to build circuits
                that could <em>emulate the entire EVM instruction
                set</em>. This meant faithfully proving the execution of
                complex operations like hashing (<code>KECCAK256</code>,
                <code>SHA3</code>), elliptic curve operations
                (precompiles like <code>ECRECOVER</code>), storage
                accesses (<code>SLOAD</code>, <code>SSTORE</code>),
                memory manipulation, and precise gas metering – all
                within the constraints of efficient ZK proving.</p>
                <p>The implications were profound:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Seamless Developer Migration:</strong>
                Existing Solidity/Vyper contracts could be deployed
                <em>unchanged</em>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Full Composability:</strong> Contracts
                could interact seamlessly, replicating the L1
                experience.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unified Liquidity and Tooling:</strong>
                Leverage existing Ethereum wallets, block explorers, and
                developer tools (Hardhat, Foundry, Remix).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Maximal Security Inheritance:</strong> By
                proving bytecode execution validity, the ZK-EVM would
                inherit Ethereum’s security for computation,
                complementing the data security provided by posting data
                to L1.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Achieving this vision, however, represented a quantum
                leap in complexity compared to application-specific
                rollups. Proving the correctness of general-purpose EVM
                execution, with its vast opcode set, intricate state
                interactions, and edge cases, was akin to building a
                cryptographic mirror of Ethereum itself. This daunting
                challenge spurred intense research and development,
                leading to diverse approaches and, crucially, the need
                for a framework to categorize them.</p>

                ZK-EVM Typology: Defining Type-2</h3>
                <p>As multiple teams (including Ethereum Foundation’s
                Privacy and Scaling Explorations group, Matter Labs,
                Scroll, Polygon Hermez, and StarkWare) raced towards the
                ZK-EVM goal in 2021-2022, their implementations diverged
                significantly in philosophy and technical approach. Some
                prioritized faster proving times by modifying the EVM,
                others sacrificed certain Ethereum features for
                efficiency, while a few aimed for maximal equivalence
                regardless of initial performance cost. This diversity
                was healthy for innovation but created confusion about
                what truly constituted a “ZK-EVM” and how different
                implementations compared.</p>

                href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html">The
                different types of ZK-EVMs</a></strong>.” This post
                provided the essential conceptual framework, classifying
                ZK-EVM projects into four distinct types based on their
                level of equivalence to the Ethereum Mainnet execution
                environment. This typology became the lingua franca for
                understanding the trade-offs in the ZK-EVM
                landscape:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Type 1 (Fully
                Ethereum-Equivalent):</strong> The ideal. Aims for
                perfect bytecode equivalence. Runs Ethereum blocks
                exactly as L1 does, using the same state tree structure.
                No modifications to the consensus layer or execution
                layer. Proves Ethereum blocks <em>as they are</em>.
                <strong>Advantages:</strong> Maximum security and
                compatibility. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Proving
                is extremely slow and resource-intensive because it must
                handle <em>all</em> Ethereum opcodes and historical
                quirks directly. (Example: Early efforts by the Ethereum
                Foundation PSE team; long-term aspiration).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 2 (Fully EVM-Equivalent):</strong>
                The focus of this encyclopedia article. <strong>Aims for
                functional equivalence to the EVM <em>at the bytecode
                level</em>.</strong> Runs <em>unmodified</em> Ethereum
                bytecode compiled from Solidity/Vyper. Uses the <em>same
                state structure</em> as Ethereum (Merkle Patricia Trie).
                <em>From the perspective of the smart contract
                developer</em>, it is indistinguishable from Ethereum
                L1. <strong>Key Distinction from Type 1:</strong> It
                might make <em>minor, Ethereum-consensus-irrelevant</em>
                simplifications (e.g., slightly modifying how the
                underlying provers handle certain precompiles or gas
                metering internally <em>for efficiency</em>, but
                ensuring the <em>observable behavior</em> matches L1
                exactly). <strong>Advantages:</strong> Near-perfect
                compatibility for developers and users; inherits
                Ethereum’s security model for execution; allows seamless
                porting of existing contracts and tools.
                <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Proving is still very
                challenging and slower than less equivalent types.
                (Examples: Scroll, Polygon zkEVM (evolving towards Type
                2), Taiko (targeting Type 1 but pragmatically starting
                near Type 2)).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 3 (Almost EVM-Equivalent):</strong>
                Makes deliberate, <em>visible</em> modifications to the
                EVM for significant prover performance gains. Common
                changes include replacing complex Ethereum precompiles
                (like <code>KECCAK256</code>, <code>MODEXP</code>) with
                functionally similar, but more ZK-friendly alternatives,
                or slightly altering gas costs or opcode behavior.
                <strong>Advantages:</strong> Much faster proving times
                and lower resource requirements than Type 2. Easier to
                build initially. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                Existing contracts <em>may require minor
                modifications</em> (e.g., recompilation with a different
                compiler version, small code tweaks for replaced
                precompiles). Some edge cases might behave differently.
                Tooling might need adaptation. (Examples: Early Polygon
                zkEVM, zkSync Era (initially, evolving), some
                configurations of Starknet’s Kakarot zkEVM).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type 4 (High-Level-Language
                Equivalent):</strong> Operates at the level of the smart
                contract’s <em>source code</em> (e.g., Solidity, Vyper).
                Instead of compiling to standard EVM bytecode and
                proving <em>that</em> execution, the ZK-EVM compiles the
                source code directly into a custom, ZK-optimized
                intermediate representation (IR) or assembly language
                (e.g., zkSync’s LLVM-based compiler, Starknet’s Cairo).
                <strong>Advantages:</strong> Potentially the fastest
                proving times and highest scalability, as the compiler
                can heavily optimize for ZK-friendliness from the start.
                <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Major incompatibility.
                Contracts must be <em>re-written or significantly
                recompiled</em> specifically for this environment.
                Standard Ethereum bytecode cannot be deployed directly.
                Composability with standard EVM contracts is broken
                unless through complex bridging/messaging. Different
                state structure. (Examples: zkSync Era’s primary mode,
                Starknet with Cairo).</p></li>

                <p><strong>Defining the Type-2 Promise:</strong></p>
                <p>The <strong>Type-2 ZK-EVM</strong> represents the
                optimal balance for the broad Ethereum ecosystem,
                particularly for developers and users seeking a
                frictionless scaling experience. Its core defining
                characteristics are:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Fully Equivalent to Ethereum:</strong>
                Smart contracts behave <em>identically</em> to how they
                behave on Ethereum L1. There are no observable
                differences in execution logic, state changes, or
                outcomes for correctly written contracts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unmodified EVM:</strong> The execution
                environment processes standard Ethereum bytecode (EVM
                object code) <em>without alteration</em>. The bytecode
                deployed on L1 can be deployed directly on the Type-2
                ZK-EVM.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Identical State Structure:</strong> The
                state is represented using the same Merkle Patricia Trie
                structure as Ethereum L1. This ensures compatibility
                with existing infrastructure (like block explorers
                indexing state) and simplifies cross-L1/L2 state
                proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Seamless Developer Experience:</strong>
                Developers can use all existing Ethereum tools (Hardhat,
                Foundry, Remix, MetaMask, Etherscan-like explorers) with
                minimal or no changes. Debugging and testing workflows
                are preserved.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Maximal Security Inheritance:</strong> By
                proving the correctness of bytecode execution against
                Ethereum’s rules and anchoring state roots to L1 via
                validity proofs, Type-2 ZK-EVMs inherit Ethereum’s
                robust security for computation. The security model
                reduces primarily to the soundness of the underlying ZK
                cryptography and the correct implementation of the
                prover and verifier.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The pursuit of Type-2 equivalence is not merely an
                academic exercise; it’s a practical necessity for
                unlocking Ethereum’s full potential without fracturing
                its ecosystem. By providing a scaling environment that
                is virtually indistinguishable from L1 for deployed
                contracts, Type-2 ZK-EVMs promise to onboard millions of
                users and billions in value seamlessly, preserving the
                network effects and composability that make Ethereum
                unique. However, achieving this vision required
                overcoming monumental engineering challenges in
                cryptography, circuit design, and systems
                architecture.</p>
                <p>The conceptual foundation laid here – the scaling
                imperative, the cryptographic power of ZKPs, the
                evolution from simple ZK-Rollups, and the rigorous
                classification of equivalence – sets the stage for
                understanding the remarkable journey of innovation and
                engineering that followed. The path from theory to a
                live, secure, and performant Type-2 ZK-EVM network
                operating at scale is a story of breakthroughs,
                trade-offs, and relentless optimization, a story we turn
                to next.</p>

                <p>The conceptual elegance of the Type-2 ZK-EVM,
                promising Ethereum equivalence without compromise, stood
                in stark contrast to the daunting practical realities of
                its implementation. Bridging this gap required not just
                theoretical brilliance but years of relentless
                engineering, iterative breakthroughs, and fierce
                collaboration within the Ethereum research community.
                This section chronicles that arduous journey, tracing
                the path from nascent academic concepts and pioneering,
                limited-scope projects through the clarifying impact of
                Vitalik Buterin’s seminal typology, culminating in the
                high-stakes race to deploy functional Type-2 systems on
                Ethereum mainnet. It was a period marked by both intense
                competition and remarkable open-source cooperation,
                driven by the shared conviction that scalable, secure
                Ethereum equivalence was the key to unlocking the
                network’s next evolutionary phase.</p>

                Early Theoretical Work and Pioneering Projects (Pre-2020
                - 2021)</h3>
                <p>The seeds of the ZK-EVM were sown long before the
                term gained widespread currency. Academic research into
                succinct proofs and their application to verifiable
                computation laid the essential groundwork. Key
                milestones predating the Ethereum scaling crisis
                included:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Foundational ZK Research:</strong> The
                theoretical underpinnings established by Goldwasser,
                Micali, and Rackoff (1985), along with the Fiat-Shamir
                heuristic (1986), provided the essential tools. Later
                breakthroughs like Pinocchio (2013) and the subsequent
                explosion of SNARK constructions (Groth16, PLONK,
                Marlin, Halo/Halo2) and STARKs (2018) demonstrated the
                <em>feasibility</em> of proving complex computations
                succinctly, albeit for specific, often hand-crafted
                examples.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Zcash (2016):</strong> While focused on
                privacy, Zcash’s implementation of the Pinocchio-based
                zk-SNARKs (later transitioning to Halo2) proved that
                complex cryptographic operations (specifically, the
                shielded transfer logic) could be efficiently verified
                on a blockchain. It served as a critical
                proof-of-concept for blockchain-applied ZKPs and
                highlighted both the power and the challenges (notably
                the trusted setup) of the technology.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Early ZK-Rollups (2018-2020):</strong>
                Projects like <strong>Loopring</strong> (mainnet Dec
                2019) and <strong>zkSync 1.0</strong> (mainnet June
                2020), built by Matter Labs, demonstrated the core
                ZK-Rollup model in production. These were, however,
                firmly in the realm of application-specific circuits.
                Loopring focused on order-book based trading, while
                zkSync 1.0 handled token transfers and simple swaps.
                Their success proved the scalability and user benefits
                (fast, cheap transactions, near-instant withdrawals) of
                ZK-Rollups but underscored the limitation: they were
                <em>not</em> general-purpose EVMs. Developers couldn’t
                deploy arbitrary smart contracts.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The conceptual leap towards a
                <em>general-purpose</em> ZK-provable virtual machine
                began crystallizing around 2020-2021, driven by the
                intensifying Ethereum gas crisis and the limitations of
                Optimistic Rollups (with their week-long withdrawal
                delays). Several key research threads emerged almost
                simultaneously:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Ethereum Foundation’s Privacy and Scaling
                Explorations (PSE) Team:</strong> Spearheaded by
                researchers like Barry Whitehat (Baryon), the PSE team
                began ambitious explorations into proving the EVM
                itself. Early efforts focused on creating ZK circuits
                for <em>individual</em> EVM opcodes, a monumental task
                given the complexity of opcodes like
                <code>KECCAK256</code>, <code>CALL</code>, and storage
                operations (<code>SLOAD</code>/<code>SSTORE</code>).
                Projects like <code>zkEVM</code> (a research prototype)
                and later <code>zeth</code> (a Type-1 prover concept)
                provided crucial open-source references and demonstrated
                the sheer scale of the challenge.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Matter Labs (zkSync):</strong> Having
                launched zkSync 1.0, Matter Labs turned their sights
                towards EVM compatibility. Their initial approach,
                however, leaned towards what would later be classified
                as Type 4. Instead of directly proving EVM bytecode,
                they developed <strong>LLVM IR → SNARK Circuit</strong>
                compiler technology (eventually powering zkSync Era),
                aiming to compile Solidity/Vyper down to a more
                ZK-friendly intermediate representation (Yul, then their
                own zkEVM assembly) <em>before</em> proving. This
                prioritized prover performance and scalability but
                sacrificed direct bytecode equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>StarkWare:</strong> Pioneers of STARKs
                with StarkEx (powering dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare),
                StarkWare announced <strong>StarkNet</strong>, a
                general-purpose ZK-Rollup, in 2020. StarkNet used its
                purpose-built, Turing-complete language
                <strong>Cairo</strong>, explicitly designed for
                efficient STARK proving. While not an EVM, the vision
                included the ability to <em>prove the execution of other
                VMs</em>, including the EVM, <em>within</em> Cairo. This
                led to projects like <strong>Kakarot</strong>, a
                Cairo-based zkEVM implementation aiming for Type 3
                equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll:</strong> Founded in 2021 by Ye
                Zhang, Sandy Peng, and Haichen Shen, Scroll emerged with
                an explicit, single-minded focus: building a
                <strong>bytecode-level equivalent ZK-EVM (Type
                2)</strong>. They adopted a collaborative, open-source
                approach from the outset, working closely with the
                Ethereum Foundation’s PSE team and academia. Their
                strategy involved meticulously mapping EVM execution to
                circuits using a combination of open-source components
                and custom innovations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon Hermez (Acquisition &amp;
                Rebrand):</strong> Polygon acquired the Hermez Network
                (a ZK-Rollup project) in August 2021 for $250 million,
                signaling its major bet on ZK technology. The newly
                formed <strong>Polygon Hermez</strong> team (including
                co-founders Jordi Baylina and David Schwartz) embarked
                on building <strong>Polygon zkEVM</strong>. Initially,
                their approach involved a custom zero-knowledge Assembly
                Language (<strong>zkASM</strong>) to interpret and prove
                EVM opcodes, positioning it closer to Type 3 initially,
                with a stated ambition to move towards Type 2
                equivalence over time.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Taiko:</strong> Founded by Daniel Wang in
                2022, Taiko entered the race with a bold vision:
                achieving <strong>Type 1 equivalence</strong>,
                essentially acting as an Ethereum L1 client that
                <em>also</em> generates ZK proofs. Recognizing the
                immense initial challenge, their practical roadmap
                started near Type 2 equivalence (“Based Contestable
                Rollup” initially) while building towards the Type 1
                ideal.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This period (2021-early 2022) was characterized by
                intense experimentation, diverse architectural choices,
                and significant technical uncertainty. Teams grappled
                with fundamental questions: How to efficiently
                circuitize complex opcodes? Which proving system (SNARK,
                STARK, hybrid) offered the best trade-offs? Could
                proving times ever be practical for full blocks? The
                landscape was fragmented, and the definition of a
                “ZK-EVM” remained fluid and contested. A unifying
                framework was desperately needed to clarify goals,

                The Classification Catalyst: Buterin’s Typology (August
                2022)</h3>
                <p>On August 4, 2022, Vitalik Buterin published the blog
                post “<a
                href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html">The
                different types of ZK-EVMs</a>”. This wasn’t just
                another technical analysis; it was a seminal moment that
                fundamentally reshaped the ZK-EVM landscape. Buterin
                introduced a clear, four-type classification system
                (Type 1 to Type 4) based on the level of equivalence to
                the Ethereum execution environment (as detailed in
                Section 1.4).</p>
                <p><strong>The Impact was Profound and
                Immediate:</strong></p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Clarity and Common Language:</strong> The
                typology provided a much-needed shared vocabulary.
                Instead of ambiguous claims of “EVM compatibility,”
                projects could now precisely define their target
                equivalence level (e.g., “aiming for Type 2” or
                “currently Type 3”). This allowed developers and users
                to understand the trade-offs (compatibility
                vs. performance) inherent in each approach.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Setting Benchmarks:</strong> Buterin
                explicitly defined the characteristics of each type,
                establishing clear benchmarks for what constituted
                equivalence. For Type 2, the gold standard became:
                <em>unmodified bytecode execution, identical state
                structure, and full equivalence observable by smart
                contracts</em>. This gave teams concrete goals to
                measure their progress against.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Focusing Development Efforts:</strong>
                The typology forced teams to explicitly articulate their
                priorities. Projects like Scroll and Taiko doubled down
                on their commitment to high equivalence (Type 2/Type 1).
                Others, like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era, acknowledged
                their initial position closer to Type 3/Type 4, framing
                it as a pragmatic step towards potential future
                equivalence while delivering usable scaling sooner. The
                typology didn’t declare one type “better,” but it
                highlighted the <em>consequences</em> of the design
                choices.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Shifting the Narrative:</strong> It moved
                the conversation beyond pure technical feasibility to
                the <em>user and developer implications</em> of
                different design choices. Buterin emphasized the immense
                value of Type 2 equivalence for seamless ecosystem
                migration, tooling compatibility, and security
                inheritance, validating the path chosen by teams like
                Scroll while acknowledging the performance advantages of
                less equivalent types.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Catalyzing the “Type 2” Race:</strong>
                Perhaps most significantly, the post crystallized
                <strong>Type 2</strong> as the ideal target for
                maximizing Ethereum compatibility while retaining the
                core benefits of ZK-Rollups. It became the explicit
                north star for several leading projects, galvanizing
                efforts and framing the subsequent competitive
                landscape. The “Race to Type 2” was officially
                on.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Buterin’s typology wasn’t static dogma; it
                acknowledged the fluidity and evolution of the field. He
                noted that projects might start in one category and
                evolve towards another (e.g., Type 3 → Type 2). However,
                by providing a clear framework, it brought unprecedented
                structure to the chaotic innovation happening across
                multiple teams, setting the stage for the next phase:
                the high-stakes dash to deliver a working Type 2 ZK-EVM
                on Ethereum mainnet.</p>

                The Race to Mainnet: Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, and Others
                (Late 2022 - 2024)</h3>
                <p>Armed with Buterin’s clarifying framework, the focus
                shifted from theoretical exploration to practical
                implementation and deployment. The period from late 2022
                through 2024 witnessed a series of escalating milestones
                as projects vied to be the first to launch a fully
                functional, secure, and production-ready Type 2 (or
                near-Type 2) ZK-EVM network. This race was characterized
                by rigorous testing, extensive security audits,
                incremental testnet deployments, and finally, the
                high-pressure mainnet launches.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Contenders and Their
                Journeys:</strong></p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Polygon zkEVM:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Announcement &amp; Testnet
                (2022):</strong> Polygon announced its zkEVM in July
                2022, leveraging the zkProver (using SNARKs with a
                Plonky2-based proving stack) and its custom zkASM. An
                internal testnet launched shortly after.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Public Testnet “Goerli” (March
                2023):</strong> A major milestone, opening the network
                to developers. This initial version was widely
                recognized as <strong>Type 3</strong>, making deliberate
                changes (e.g., a custom <code>KECCAK</code>
                implementation, modified gas costs for some operations)
                for performance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mainnet Beta Launch (March 27,
                2023):</strong> Polygon zkEVM became the <strong>first
                EVM-equivalent ZK-Rollup to launch on Ethereum
                mainnet</strong>, albeit labeled “Beta” and explicitly
                Type 3. This was a massive achievement, proving the core
                technology in a live environment, but full equivalence
                wasn’t yet claimed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Path to Type 2:</strong> Polygon
                Hermez immediately embarked on a concerted effort dubbed
                the “<strong>Journey to Full EVM Equivalence</strong>.”
                Key upgrades followed:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Dragonfruit (Fork ID 5, July
                2023):</strong> Improved handling of
                <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> and
                <code>DELEGATECALL</code>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Inca Berry (Fork ID 7, Expected
                2024):</strong> Targeted crucial upgrades like full
                Keccak equivalence (Poseidon → Keccak), precise gas cost
                matching for all opcodes, and enhanced precompile
                support. This fork aimed to solidify its claim as a
                <strong>Type 2 ZK-EVM</strong>. While achieving
                significant equivalence improvements, nuances around
                edge cases like transient storage and potential gas cost
                discrepancies under specific conditions meant some still
                classified it as “very close to Type 2” rather than
                fully Type 2 by strictest definitions by
                mid-2024.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Polygon faced
                significant hurdles, including initially high proving
                costs, longer proving times impacting finality, and the
                inherent complexity of retrofitting full equivalence
                onto a system initially designed with optimizations. The
                “Beta” label remained indicative of ongoing
                refinement.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Research &amp; Pre-Alpha Testnet
                (2022):</strong> Scroll adopted a meticulous,
                research-driven approach from the start. They built upon
                and contributed significantly to the Ethereum Foundation
                PSE team’s <code>zkevm-circuits</code> (based on Halo2),
                integrating it with a custom witness generator and
                coordinator.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Alpha Testnet (February 2023):</strong>
                Launched a permissioned testnet for developers, focusing
                on core infrastructure stability and basic contract
                deployment/execution.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Uniswap v2 Fork Test (Mid-2023):</strong>
                A pivotal demonstration. Scroll successfully forked and
                ran the <em>unmodified</em> Uniswap v2 contracts from
                Ethereum mainnet on their testnet, showcasing the
                practical reality of bytecode-level equivalence for
                complex, real-world DeFi logic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Goerli Testnet (August 2023):</strong>
                Launched a public, permissionless testnet on Ethereum’s
                Goerli testnet, opening to all users and developers.
                This demonstrated significant progress in stability and
                compatibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mainnet Launch (October 17,
                2023):</strong> Following rigorous security audits,
                Scroll launched its mainnet on Ethereum L1. Crucially,
                Scroll consistently emphasized its <strong>commitment to
                Type 2 equivalence from the outset</strong>. Its
                architecture was designed ground-up for bytecode-level
                fidelity, using an unmodified Go-Ethereum (Geth)
                execution client under the hood and meticulously mapping
                EVM execution traces to Halo2 circuits. While also
                launching in a “beta” phase acknowledging ongoing
                optimization, its equivalence claims were stronger from
                day one on mainnet compared to Polygon’s initial
                launch.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Scroll faced its own
                proving time and cost hurdles, particularly for blocks
                containing complex transactions. Debugging ZK proofs
                remained notoriously difficult. Achieving true gas cost
                parity with L1 was also a complex challenge due to the
                inherent overhead of proving and differences in L1 data
                posting costs (mitigated partially by EIP-4844
                blobs).</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Vision &amp; Testnets
                (2022-2023):</strong> Taiko’s audacious Type 1 vision
                captured attention. They launched a series of testnets
                (Alpha-1, Alpha-2, Alpha-3) throughout 2023, each
                increasing in complexity and decentralization. Their
                architecture aimed to use Ethereum’s own execution
                clients (like Geth) as the sequencer executor,
                minimizing divergence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Based Rollup &amp; Contestation
                Mechanism:</strong> Recognizing the impracticality of
                immediate Type 1 proving for all blocks, Taiko innovated
                with a “<strong>Based Contestable Rollup</strong>”
                model. A single “Proposer” (initially centralized,
                moving towards permissionless) posts blocks and proofs.
                If a proof is missing, slow, or suspected invalid, nodes
                can issue “contests” backed by bonds. An Ethereum L1
                smart contract then verifies the contest via a succinct
                ZK fault proof. This hybrid model provided practical
                liveness while leveraging ZKPs for security and eventual
                finality.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Katla A6 Testnet &amp; Mainnet Target
                (2024):</strong> Following the “Katla” testnet series,
                Taiko launched its final testnet stage (“A6”) in Q1
                2024, moving closer to permissionless proving and
                decentralization. While explicitly targeting Type 1
                long-term, its initial practical equivalence upon
                planned mainnet launch (mid-2024) was acknowledged to be
                effectively <strong>Type 2</strong>, as it aimed to run
                unmodified L1 bytecode and state structures. The
                contestation mechanism provided a safety net during the
                proving performance ramp-up phase.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Shared Challenges in the Race:</strong></p>
                <p>Despite different architectures, all projects
                grappled with similar core technical hurdles:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proving Times:</strong> Generating proofs
                for full blocks containing complex transactions (large
                DEX swaps, intricate DeFi interactions) could take
                minutes to hours initially, far exceeding Ethereum’s
                12-second block time. This impacted user experience
                (finality latency) and required sophisticated block
                production strategies.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Circuit Complexity:</strong> The sheer
                number of constraints required to represent EVM
                execution, especially for opcodes like
                <code>KECCAK</code>, <code>SHA3</code>,
                <code>MODEXP</code>, and storage operations, resulted in
                massive circuits. Managing, compiling, and optimizing
                these circuits was a major engineering
                challenge.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gas Cost Equivalence:</strong> While the
                <em>execution</em> gas cost could theoretically match
                L1, the <em>overhead</em> of generating the ZK proof and
                posting data to L1 meant the total cost to the user (L2
                execution fee + L1 data/verification fee) was often
                higher than L1 for simple transactions initially.
                Projects aggressively optimized provers and leveraged
                EIP-4844 to close this gap.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Debugging the Black Box:</strong>
                Troubleshooting failed transactions or proof generation
                errors was extremely difficult. The ZK prover operates
                as a complex “black box”; understanding why a valid
                execution trace failed to generate a proof, or
                interpreting cryptic prover errors, became a major pain
                point for developers. Enhanced tooling (local provers,
                better error logging) was a critical area of
                development.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Audits:</strong> Given the
                enormous value potentially secured, undergoing multiple,
                rigorous security audits by reputable firms (like
                OpenZeppelin, Zellic, Trail of Bits, Halborn) was
                non-negotiable but time-consuming before mainnet
                launch.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The period culminated with Polygon zkEVM and Scroll
                securing their places as the first major
                “EVM-equivalent” ZK-Rollups on mainnet, while Taiko
                refined its unique contestable model. The race, however,
                was far from over; achieving not just launch, but
                <em>performance, stability, cost-effectiveness, and true
                decentralization</em> became the next frontier. This
                evolution was critically dependent on breakthroughs in
                the underlying proving systems and hardware.</p>

                <p>The dream of a practical Type 2 ZK-EVM hinged on
                making the generation of ZK proofs for complex EVM
                execution not just possible, but sufficiently fast and
                affordable. This demanded relentless innovation in the

                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Plonky2 (Polygon Zero):</strong>
                Developed by Polygon’s Zero team (formerly Mir
                Protocol), Plonky2 emerged in late 2021 as a
                groundbreaking recursive SNARK. Its key innovation was

                it ideal for Polygon zkEVM’s architecture, enabling
                efficient proof aggregation and reducing the final
                verification cost on L1. Plonky2 significantly improved

                Contract</h3>
                <p>A Type-2 ZK-EVM is not a monolithic entity but a
                distributed system composed of several critical roles,
                often implemented as separate software modules or
                services:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>The Sequencer: The Transaction
                Conductor</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Role:</strong> Acts as the primary point
                of contact for users. It receives transactions from
                users’ wallets (via RPC endpoints), orders them into a
                sequence (a “block” or “batch”), and initiates the
                processing pipeline. It is the <strong>liveness
                engine</strong> of the L2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transaction Pool (Mempool)
                Management:</strong> Receives, validates basic
                syntax/signatures, and holds pending transactions.
                Implements transaction replacement policies (e.g.,
                replace-by-fee) similar to Ethereum.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transaction Ordering:</strong> Determines
                the sequence of transactions within a batch/block. This
                is critical as order affects execution results (e.g.,
                nonces, contract state changes). Initially, sequencing
                is often centralized for efficiency and simplicity (a
                known centralization vector discussed in Section 6.3),
                but decentralization mechanisms (PoS, fair ordering
                protocols like SUAVE) are active areas of
                development.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Batch/Block Construction:</strong>
                Packages the ordered transactions into a unit (a “batch”
                or “L2 block”) ready for execution and proving. Includes
                metadata like the previous state root and
                timestamp.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Initiating Execution:</strong> Sends the
                transaction batch to the
                <strong>Executor</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Data Availability (DA)
                Publishing:</strong> After execution, posts the
                <em>essential transaction data</em> (more in 3.2) to
                Ethereum L1, either as calldata or within EIP-4844
                blobs. This ensures anyone can reconstruct the L2 state
                if needed and is fundamental to the system’s
                security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> In Scroll’s
                architecture, the sequencer uses a slightly modified
                version of Geth (Go-Ethereum) to handle the mempool and
                block construction logic, leveraging familiar Ethereum
                client infrastructure. Polygon zkEVM’s sequencer

                execution clients:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Geth (Go-Ethereum):</strong> Used by
                Scroll and Taiko. Minor modifications might be needed
                for integration (e.g., hooking into witness generation)
                but <em>not</em> to the core EVM logic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Nethermind / Erigon / Besu:</strong>
                Other Ethereum execution clients could theoretically be
                integrated.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Identical State:</strong> The executor
                interacts with a <strong>State Database</strong> that
                precisely mirrors Ethereum’s Merkle Patricia Trie
                structure. Executing a transaction involves reading
                (<code>SLOAD</code>) and writing (<code>SSTORE</code>)
                state exactly as on L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Output:</strong> The primary outputs of
                execution are:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The New State Root:</strong> The
                cryptographic hash (root) of the state trie after
                applying all transactions in the batch.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Execution Trace:</strong> A complete,
                step-by-step record of <em>every</em> operation the EVM
                performed during the batch’s execution. This includes
                every opcode executed, the stack/memory/state at each
                step, gas consumed per opcode, program counter values,
                and results of internal calls. This trace is the
                <strong>ground truth</strong> that the ZK proof must
                attest to. Generating this trace is computationally
                expensive but essential.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of the Executor
                as a meticulous court stenographer, recording verbatim
                everything that happens during the trial (transaction
                execution), while also updating the official record
                (state).</p></li>

                witness”) suitable for input into the proving system’s
                arithmetic circuit. This involves serializing the trace
                data into the finite field elements used by the
                cryptography. (See Section 3.4 for deep dive).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Generation (Proving):</strong>
                Executes the complex cryptographic algorithms (e.g.,
                Plonky2, Halo2, Boojum) using the witness as input to
                generate the actual ZK proof. This involves massive
                amounts of parallel computation (MSMs, FFTs/NTTs – see
                Section 4), typically performed on high-end GPUs or
                specialized hardware (FPGAs/ASICs).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Output:</strong> A small cryptographic
                proof (often kilobytes in size) and the associated
                public inputs (e.g., the old state root, the new state
                root, the batch hash).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The sheer complexity
                of the EVM makes generating this proof slow and
                resource-intensive. Proving a block containing complex
                DeFi transactions could initially take minutes to hours,
                though hardware acceleration and algorithmic
                improvements constantly push this down (Section 4.3).
                Projects often run multiple provers in parallel or
                utilize cloud-based proving services.</p></li>

                arbiter of state validity. It receives the compact ZK
                proof and the public inputs (old state root, new state
                root, batch data commitment) posted by the Sequencer (or
                a dedicated Relayer).</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Proof Verification:</strong> Executes a
                highly optimized verification algorithm within the EVM.
                This algorithm checks the cryptographic proof against
                the public inputs. The computation is deliberately kept
                <em>much</em> simpler and cheaper than proof
                generation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>State Root Finalization:</strong>
                <strong>If and only if</strong> the proof verification
                passes, the Verifier Contract accepts the proposed new
                state root as valid. It typically stores this root,
                effectively finalizing the state transition on L1. This
                is the point of <strong>cryptographic finality</strong>
                – the state change is now secured by Ethereum’s
                consensus.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Importance:</strong> This contract is the
                bedrock of the ZK-Rollup’s security. Its correct
                implementation and the soundness of the underlying
                cryptographic protocol are paramount. It enforces the
                rule: <em>Only valid state transitions, proven correct
                via ZK, can update the canonical L2 state root on
                L1.</em></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example Cost:</strong> Scroll’s early
                Halo2-based verifier contract consumed around 500K-800K
                gas for verification. Aggregation and recursion (Section
                4.4) aim to drastically reduce this. Polygon zkEVM’s
                Plonky2 verifier, benefiting from recursion, achieved
                significantly lower gas costs.</p></li>

                <p>Maintaining Ethereum-equivalent state and ensuring
                its data is available for verification are fundamental
                responsibilities of a Type-2 ZK-EVM, tightly coupled
                with its security model.</p>

                <li><strong>Maintaining the Ethereum State
                Trie:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Structure:</strong> Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                rigorously replicate Ethereum’s <strong>Merkle Patricia
                Trie (MPT)</strong> structure for account storage. This
                trie is a cryptographically authenticated data structure
                combining a Patricia trie (for efficient lookup) and
                Merkle trees (for hash-based authentication). Each
                account (Externally Owned Account or Contract) has its
                own storage trie. The root hash of the global state trie
                (the <strong>State Root</strong>) succinctly represents
                the entire state.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why Identical?</strong> Type-2 mandates
                this for several reasons:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Existing tools
                (block explorers, indexers, wallets) expect and
                understand the MPT structure. Using the same structure
                ensures seamless integration.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cross-Layer Proofs:</strong> Facilitating
                trust-minimized bridging and messaging between L1 and L2
                relies on the ability to generate Merkle proofs against
                a shared state structure. A different structure would
                break standard Ethereum libraries and require complex
                adapters.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Inheritance:</strong> The
                security properties of the MPT are well-understood
                within Ethereum’s context. Changing it introduces
                unnecessary risk and complexity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The Executor
                interacts with a State Database (e.g., a modified
                version of GoLevelDB or BadgerDB, often integrated
                within the Geth/Nethermind client) that implements the
                MPT. Every <code>SLOAD</code> and <code>SSTORE</code>
                opcode execution updates the trie, eventually leading to
                a new State Root after processing a batch.</p></li>

                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> The ZK proof
                attests that the <em>execution</em> was correct
                <em>given the transactions</em>. However, if the
                transaction data itself is withheld, the proof becomes
                meaningless. No one can verify the starting point or
                reconstruct the state if needed (e.g., if the sequencer
                disappears). <strong>DA ensures that anyone can obtain
                the data necessary to verify the state transitions or
                reconstruct the state.</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Solutions and Trade-offs:</strong> Type-2
                ZK-EVMs primarily rely on Ethereum L1 for DA, leveraging
                two main mechanisms:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Call Data:</strong> The traditional
                method. The Sequencer posts the raw transaction data (or
                a compressed form) as <code>calldata</code> in a
                transaction on L1. This data is permanently stored
                on-chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Pros:</em> Maximum security; inherits
                Ethereum’s full data availability guarantees.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Cons:</em> Extremely expensive. Pre-EIP-4844,
                calldata costs dominated L2 transaction fees, especially
                for complex interactions. Costs scale linearly with data
                size.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Blobs (EIP-4844 -
                Proto-Danksharding):</strong> Introduced in the Dencun
                upgrade (March 2024), this is a revolutionary
                improvement.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Mechanism:</em> Data is posted in large,
                dedicated “blobs” (~128 KB each) attached to L1 blocks.
                Blobs are <em>not</em> stored permanently by Ethereum
                execution clients; they are only stored for ~18 days
                (sufficient time for verification and any potential
                challenges). Nodes are expected to retain blobs longer
                via peer-to-peer networks.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Pros:</em> <strong>Dramatically cheaper DA
                (estimated 10-100x reduction vs. calldata).</strong>
                Enables significantly lower L2 transaction fees while
                maintaining strong security guarantees during the
                retention window.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Cons:</em> Requires active participation from
                node operators for longer-term storage (solved by
                emerging “blob archivers”). Security model is slightly
                different from permanent calldata but widely considered
                sufficient for L2s.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Type-2 DA Requirements:</strong> For
                Type-2 equivalence, it’s essential that <em>enough
                data</em> is published to L1 to allow any honest party
                to:</p></li>

                public input to the Verifier Contract. The actual data
                is published via calldata or blobs. Anyone can check

                accepts the <code>new_state_root</code> as valid and
                final. This root is stored on-chain as the latest
                canonical representation of the L2 state. This update
                typically happens within minutes of the batch being
                executed on L2, providing <strong>fast cryptographic
                finality</strong> compared to Optimistic Rollup’s 7-day

                proofs) or optionally verify the ZK proof themselves.

                users withdraw assets from L2 to L1, proving their L2
                balance or ownership within the finalized state trie.
                The identical state structure ensures these proofs are

                <p>While simple arithmetic opcodes map relatively
                efficiently to arithmetic circuits, several EVM features
                pose significant challenges for ZK proving due to their
                computational complexity or non-arithmetic nature:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Hashing (<code>KECCAK256</code>,
                <code>SHA3</code>):</strong> The core Ethereum hash
                function. Proving a single <code>KECCAK256</code> hash
                involves simulating hundreds of bit-level operations
                (AND, XOR, shifts) within the finite field of the ZK
                proof system, which is incredibly expensive. A naive
                implementation could consume millions of constraints per
                hash.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Solution: Lookup Arguments.</strong>
                Projects leverage advanced techniques like
                <strong>logarithmic derivative lookups (logUp)</strong>
                or <strong>Plookup/CQ</strong> variants. Instead of
                proving each bit operation step-by-step, the prover
                demonstrates that the input-output pair of the hash
                exists within a massive, precomputed table of valid
                <code>(input, output)</code> pairs for the Keccak
                function. The proof verifies this membership
                efficiently. Building and managing these tables
                efficiently is complex, but it reduces the constraint
                count dramatically (e.g., from millions to thousands per
                hash). Scroll’s <code>zkevm-circuits</code> and Polygon
                zkEVM’s zkASM prover both utilize sophisticated lookup
                arguments for Keccak.</p></li>

                <em>and</em> behavior precisely. Type-2 equivalence
                demands that these precompiles respond identically to
                their L1 counterparts when called.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Storage Operations
                (<code>SLOAD</code>/<code>SSTORE</code>):</strong> While
                reading a storage slot is conceptually simple,
                <em>proving</em> that the value read is correct relative
                to the state trie root is complex. It requires proving
                the correct traversal of the Merkle Patricia Trie path
                down to the specific slot. Each storage access
                effectively involves proving a Merkle inclusion proof
                within the ZK circuit. Techniques like caching witness
                data for frequently accessed slots and optimized trie
                traversal circuits are essential. Persistent storage
                patterns significantly impact proving
                complexity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Memory Management
                (<code>MLOAD</code>/<code>MSTORE</code>):</strong>
                Proving correct memory reads and writes involves range
                checks (to ensure addresses are within bounds) and
                potentially proving consistency between memory states at
                different execution steps. While less complex than
                storage, it adds non-trivial overhead, especially for
                contracts using large memory buffers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Context Operations (<code>CALL</code>,
                <code>DELEGATECALL</code>,
                <code>CREATE</code>):</strong> Proving the correct setup
                and teardown of call contexts, including stack depth
                limits, gas forwarding, value transfer, and state
                isolation between calls, adds significant complexity to
                the circuit. Handling reverts correctly across calls is
                critical.</p></li>

                <li><p>The base cost of each opcode.</p></li>
                <li><p>Dynamic costs (e.g., memory expansion costs,

                exponent size).</p></li>
                <li><p>Gas refund rules (<code>SSTORE</code> clears,
                <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why it Matters:</strong> Predictable gas
                costs are crucial for contract functionality (e.g.,
                checks like <code>require(gasleft() &gt; 5000)</code>),
                user fee estimation, and preventing economic attacks.
                Divergence breaks compatibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The Executor
                (using its standard EVM) calculates gas consumption per
                opcode precisely. This gas usage is recorded
                step-by-step in the execution trace. The ZK proof must
                then <em>attest</em> that this gas accounting was
                performed correctly according to Ethereum’s rules. The
                circuit includes constraints enforcing that the gas
                recorded at each step matches the expected cost of the
                opcode executed and that the total gas consumed equals
                the amount deducted from the sender’s balance. Achieving
                true <em>total cost</em> parity (L2 exec fee + L1
                DA/verification fee) with L1 remains a challenge
                (Section 5.2), but the <em>execution gas</em> itself
                must be equivalent.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Executor’s ability to run unmodified bytecode and
                generate a trace capturing every nuance of EVM
                execution, including the precise handling of these
                complex operations and gas metering, is the bedrock of
                Type-2 equivalence. But this trace is just raw data.
                Transforming it into a cryptographic proof requires the
                next critical phase: witness generation and circuit
                mapping.</p>

                Bridging this gap – translating the concrete,
                step-by-step EVM execution into the abstract language of
                polynomials and finite field arithmetic – is the task of
                witness generation and circuit design. This phase
                embodies the core challenge of the ZK-EVM: creating a
                mathematical representation of the EVM that is both

                Conversion:</strong> Trace data (numbers, addresses,

                with the finite field (typically a large prime field
                ~254 bits) used by the proving system (e.g., BN254,
                BLS12-381). Bytes are split into field elements; large
                integers might be represented in base-2 limbs.</p></li>

                witness organizes the data according to the layout
                expected by the ZK circuit. This involves defining
                columns or vectors representing the state at each step
                (PC, opcode, stack[0], stack[1], …, memory[addr],
                storage[key], gas, etc.). For circuits using techniques
                like Plonkish arithmetization, the witness fills a large
                table where each row represents an execution step or a

                values needed for constraints aren’t directly in the
                trace but can be <em>derived</em> correctly given the
                trace. The witness generator calculates these “advices”
                (e.g., the result of an internal hash computation
                implied by the inputs and outputs recorded in the

                requiring significant RAM and fast storage. Optimizing

                of arithmetic equations (constraints) over a finite
                field. The prover’s job is to find an assignment to the

                proving the computation was performed correctly. The
                circuit designer’s job is to create constraints that
                <em>exactly</em> mirror the logic of the computation
                being proved – in this case, the EVM execution.</p></li>

                ZK-EVMs employ different strategies:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Direct Circuit Mapping (Scroll, PSE
                <code>zkevm-circuits</code>):</strong> Maps the EVM
                execution trace almost step-by-step to a circuit. Each
                EVM opcode is implemented as a set of constraints
                enforcing its correct execution given the prior state
                (stack, memory, storage) and producing the correct next
                state. The circuit is structured to handle the
                sequential flow of execution, jumps, calls, etc. This
                approach prioritizes fidelity and equivalence but
                results in very large, complex circuits.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>zkASM / Custom Assembly (Polygon
                zkEVM):</strong> Introduces an intermediate layer. The
                EVM bytecode is first translated into a custom,
                ZK-optimized assembly language (zkASM). This zkASM is
                designed to be easier to represent in ZK circuits than
                raw EVM opcodes. The prover then proves the correct
                execution of the zkASM program. While the <em>observable
                behavior</em> must match the EVM, the internal execution
                steps differ. This can simplify circuit design and
                improve prover performance but adds complexity to the
                executor/translator and requires rigorous testing to
                ensure behavioral equivalence. Polygon zkEVM uses this
                approach, though it has evolved significantly towards
                direct equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VM-in-VM (RISC Zero, zkLLVM):</strong>
                Some approaches (more common in Type 3/4) involve
                compiling EVM bytecode (or Solidity) down to the
                instruction set of a simpler, ZK-optimized virtual
                machine (like RISC-V). The prover then proves correct
                execution of <em>that</em> VM. Type-2 requires the VM to

                <p>Creating a circuit that can handle arbitrary EVM

                that input-output tuples exist within a pre-defined
                lookup table. The circuit only needs constraints to
                enforce the lookup relationship. This drastically

                (e.g., a 32-bit addition with carry handling, a specific
                elliptic curve point addition) as a <em>single</em> gate
                in the circuit, replacing potentially hundreds of basic

                <p>The witness generation and circuit mapping process is
                where the rubber meets the road for Type-2 equivalence.
                It demands an extraordinary depth of understanding in
                both the minutiae of the EVM specification and the
                arcane art of ZK circuit design. Every optimization must
                be scrutinized to ensure it doesn’t introduce
                divergence. The resulting circuits are vast, intricate
                tapestries of constraints, embodying the collective
                effort to make the unruly EVM amenable to the elegant,
                unforgiving logic of zero-knowledge proofs. Generating
                the actual proof from this witness and circuit is the

                Proving System Choices: SNARKs, STARKs, and Hybrids</h3>
                <p>The choice of proving system underpins the entire
                security and performance profile of a Type-2 ZK-EVM.
                This decision involves navigating a complex landscape of
                cryptographic protocols, each with distinct strengths
                and weaknesses tailored to the Herculean task of
                verifying EVM execution. The major contenders and their
                trade-offs are:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Halo 2 and Variants (Scroll, Taiko, Ethereum
                Foundation PSE):</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Core Technology:</strong> Developed by
                the Electric Coin Company (Zcash), Halo 2 leverages
                polynomial commitments (particularly KZG commitments)
                and achieves <strong>recursion without a trusted
                setup</strong>. Its flexibility in circuit design
                through custom gates and lookup arguments made it a
                natural fit for the intricate requirements of EVM
                equivalence.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><em>Trusted Setup:</em> Utilizes a
                <strong>Perpetual Powers of Tau</strong> ceremony – a
                universal, updatable, and massively multi-party trusted
                setup (thousands of participants). While significantly
                reducing trust compared to single-circuit setups, it
                doesn’t eliminate it entirely. The risk of toxic waste
                compromise, though extremely low due to the ceremony
                scale, remains a theoretical concern.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Proof Size:</em> Moderate (~10-50 KB for EVM
                blocks), larger than Groth16 but smaller than early
                STARKs. Proof size grows logarithmically with
                computation complexity.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Verification Cost (L1 Gas):</em> Relatively
                high initially (500K-800K gas for Scroll’s early
                implementation), driven by the cost of elliptic curve
                operations and pairings on-chain. Aggregation (Section
                4.4) is critical for cost reduction.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Prover Time/Memory:</em> Highly dependent on
                implementation and hardware. GPU acceleration is
                essential. Proving complex blocks could take minutes to
                hours initially, but aggressive optimization and
                hardware advances rapidly improved this.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Post-Quantum (PQ) Considerations:</em> The
                KZG commitment scheme relies on the hardness of the
                Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), vulnerable to
                sufficiently large quantum computers. Migration paths
                involve switching to hash-based commitments (like FRI
                used in STARKs) within a Halo-like framework, though
                this increases proof size and verification cost.
                Research is active (e.g., folding schemes like Nova,
                based on discrete logs but with different
                properties).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Why Chosen?</strong> Scroll and Taiko
                prioritized <strong>open-source collaboration,
                flexibility for EVM circuit design, and the elimination
                of project-specific trusted setups</strong> by
                leveraging the Perpetual Powers of Tau. The PSE team’s
                <code>zkevm-circuits</code> project, built on Halo2,
                provided a strong foundation. Halo2’s native support for
                recursion was also a major long-term advantage.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Core Technology:</strong> Developed by
                Polygon Zero (formerly Mir Protocol). Plonky2 is a
                <strong>STARK-based recursive SNARK</strong> – it uses
                FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs) for
                transparency and fast proving, wrapped in a SNARK layer
                (using techniques from PLONK) for small final proof size
                and efficient recursion.</p></li>

                hashes (collision resistance), making it resistant to
                both classical and quantum attacks (FRI is plausibly
                post-quantum secure). This was a major philosophical
                choice for Polygon.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Proof Size:</em> Larger than SNARKs (~100-300
                KB for EVM blocks) due to the FRI layer, but the
                recursive SNARK wrapper keeps the final on-chain proof
                manageable (~45 KB).</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Verification Cost (L1 Gas):</em> Very low
                (~200K-300K gas for Polygon zkEVM), a key advantage. The
                FRI-based verification is efficient on-chain, and
                recursion allows aggregating many proofs into

                (especially with GPU acceleration), particularly for

                <li><p><em>Post-Quantum (PQ) Considerations:</em> FRI is
                based on hash functions, considered secure against

                recursively verifying the STARK proof within the
                SNARK.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using a transparent STARK for fast proving, then
                wrapping the final proof in a SNARK for minimal on-chain

                <li><p><strong>Potential:</strong> Hybrids aim for the
                “best of both worlds”: STARK-like prover speed and
                transparency, coupled with SNARK-like small proof size
                and cheap verification. Projects like Polygon CDK are

                <p>Confronting this complexity demanded revolutionary

                An advanced technique pioneered by researchers like
                Ulrich Haböck and implemented in projects like Scroll
                and Polygon. It allows proving that a value
                <code>y</code> is the output of a function
                <code>f(x)</code> by showing a relationship involving a
                running product over a precomputed table of
                <code>(x, y)</code> pairs. Its key advantage is
                <strong>sub-linear proof size growth</strong> relative
                to table size.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Range Checks:</strong> Proving a value
                lies within a range (e0-255 for a byte) using lookups is

                techniques (Plookup, cq) reduced <code>KECCAK256</code>
                from millions to thousands of constraints. They are also
                used for <code>SHA256</code>, bitwise ops

                block section) that are proven separately and then
                composed recursively into a single final proof. This
                improves parallelism, reduces peak memory usage, and

                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Polygon’s approach
                introduces an intermediate Zero-Knowledge Assembly
                Language. The EVM bytecode is first compiled into zkASM
                instructions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Optimization Rationale:</strong> zkASM
                instructions are designed to be more “ZK-friendly” than
                raw EVM opcodes. They abstract some of the EVM’s
                complexity into operations that map more efficiently to
                the underlying proof system’s constraints (Plonky2 in
                their case). For example, a single zkASM instruction
                might handle a sequence of stack manipulations or memory
                accesses that would require multiple EVM opcodes and
                constraints.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trade-off:</strong> While improving
                prover efficiency, this layer introduces a translation
                step. Rigorous testing and formal verification are
                essential to ensure the zkASM interpretation
                <em>exactly</em> matches the observable behavior of the
                EVM bytecode. Polygon’s ongoing “Journey to Full EVM
                Equivalence” involves refining zkASM and its compiler to
                eliminate any divergence.</p></li>

                promising architectural innovation to overcome the
                performance and cost limitations of monolithic proving,
                fundamentally reshaping the scalability trajectory of

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Recursion:</strong> A ZK proof can verify
                the correctness of <em>another</em> ZK proof (or
                multiple proofs), along with some additional
                computation. This allows building a hierarchy of
                proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Combining multiple
                proofs (e.g., proofs for individual transactions or
                small batches) into a single, succinct final proof using
                recursion.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Drastically Reduced On-Chain Verification
                Cost:</strong> The single aggregated proof submitted to
                the L1 Verifier Contract is small and cheap to verify,
                regardless of how many transactions or sub-proofs it
                encompasses. This <strong>amortizes</strong> the fixed
                L1 gas cost over many transactions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> Verifying one
                aggregated proof for 100 transactions costs nearly the
                same as verifying one proof for a single transaction.
                This is essential for making small transactions
                economically viable on L2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Faster Finality:</strong> Sub-proofs for
                smaller units (transactions, chunks of a block) can be
                generated faster and in parallel. While the final
                aggregation step takes time, users can achieve
                <strong>softer finality</strong> upon inclusion in a
                proven sub-batch, with cryptographic finality upon L1
                acceptance of the aggregate proof minutes later. This
                improves user experience compared to waiting for a full
                block proof.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Improved Prover Scalability &amp;
                Decentralization:</strong> Smaller sub-proofs can be
                generated by less powerful machines (potentially even
                consumer GPUs in the future). Specialized aggregator
                nodes can then combine them. This enables distributed
                proving networks, mitigating the centralization pressure
                of massive, monolithic provers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Incremental Proving:</strong> New
                transactions can be proven and added to an existing
                aggregate proof without reproving everything from
                scratch, improving efficiency.</p></li>

                deliver an environment indistinguishable from Ethereum
                Mainnet for deployed contracts and interacting users?
                This question transcends theoretical purity, striking at
                the heart of the technology’s value proposition. While
                Sections 3 and 4 detailed how equivalence is
                <em>engineered</em>, this section scrutinizes how it
                <em>manifests</em> in practice. We move beyond the

                deployments, the predictable gas costs, the handling of
                Ethereum’s idiosyncratic precompiles, and the

                <li><p><strong>Differential Fuzzing:</strong> The gold
                standard. Tools like <strong>HEVM</strong> (from
                DappTools/Foundry) or custom frameworks execute the
                <em>same</em> transaction or contract call
                <em>simultaneously</em> on a reference Ethereum client
                (e.g., Geth) and the ZK-EVM executor. They
                compare:</p></li>

                <li><p>Gas consumed at every step and overall.</p></li>

                instrumented).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fuzzers generate millions of random or structured
                inputs (e.g., varying call data, block properties,
                sender balances) to probe edge cases. Projects like
                Scroll and the EF PSE team developed extensive
                differential fuzzing harnesses, uncovering subtle
                discrepancies in initial implementations, such as
                off-by-one errors in memory expansion gas costs or
                slight variations in <code>MODEXP</code> results under
                specific edge conditions.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Fork Tests:</strong> Taking a snapshot of
                the <em>actual</em> Ethereum Mainnet state at a specific
                block and “forking” it onto the ZK-EVM testnet. Real,
                deployed mainnet contracts (like Uniswap, USDC, DAI) are
                then interacted with directly on the ZK-EVM. This tests
                compatibility with complex, real-world state layouts and
                contract interactions that are difficult to synthesize
                with fuzzing alone. Successfully processing mainnet fork
                blocks is a major milestone.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> While
                challenging for the entire EVM, targeted formal methods
                verify critical components. For example, Kakarot
                (Starknet’s zkEVM) leveraged the K framework to formally
                specify and verify parts of its EVM interpreter against
                the Ethereum Yellow Paper. Projects also formally verify
                equivalence between different implementations of
                critical components, like Keccak lookup
                circuits.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Test Vector Suites:</strong> Consuming
                standardized Ethereum execution test vectors (like those
                from the Ethereum Execution Specs or client test suites)
                to ensure compliance with consensus-critical
                behavior.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The relentless pursuit of bytecode equivalence is a
                continuous process. Ethereum protocol upgrades (like
                Shanghai/Cancun or future Verkle transitions) require
                corresponding updates to the ZK-EVM’s execution client
                and circuits to maintain parity. However, by mid-2024,
                leading Type-2 implementations demonstrated near-perfect
                bytecode equivalence for the vast majority of contract
                interactions, validating the core promise for
                developers. Yet, equivalence in execution logic is only
                one pillar; the economic experience must also align.</p>

                Gas Cost Parity: Economics of Compatibility</h3>
                <p>While bytecode equivalence ensures a contract
                <em>consumes</em> gas identically on L1 and L2 for the
                <em>same execution</em>, the <em>total cost</em> a user
                pays per transaction on a ZK-Rollup involves additional
                layers. Achieving <strong>gas cost parity</strong> –
                where the user’s total fee on L2 is comparable to or
                lower than L1 for equivalent transactions – is crucial
                for predictable economics and adoption, but it presents
                distinct challenges separate from pure execution
                equivalence.</p>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Contract Functionality:</strong> Many
                contracts contain logic sensitive to absolute gas costs.
                Examples include:</p></li>
                <li><p>Checks like
                <code>require(gasleft() &gt; X)</code> to ensure
                sufficient gas remains for sub-calls.</p></li>
                <li><p>Gas refund calculations based on precise
                <code>SSTORE</code> clearing costs.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mechanisms estimating gas costs for internal
                operations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>User Experience:</strong> Users and
                wallet providers rely on fee estimation tools (like ETH
                Gas Station or MetaMask’s estimator). Significant
                divergence from L1 gas behavior breaks these tools and
                leads to unexpected failures or overpayment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Economic Viability:</strong> The core
                promise of L2s is lower fees. If the <em>execution</em>
                gas cost is identical but the <em>total</em> fee is
                higher due to overhead, the value proposition erodes,
                especially for simple transfers.</p></li>

                <p>A user’s fee on a Type-2 ZK-EVM typically

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>L2 Execution Fee:</strong> Covers the
                cost of the Sequencer executing the transaction on the
                unmodified EVM. <strong>This fee is calculated using gas
                <em>identical</em> to L1.</strong> A simple transfer
                consumes 21,000 gas; a swap might consume 150,000 gas,
                just like on Mainnet. The L2 base fee (in gwei) might be
                lower than L1’s due to lower resource costs
                off-chain.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Data Availability (DA) Fee:</strong>
                Covers the cost of publishing transaction data to
                Ethereum L1 (via calldata or EIP-4844 blobs). This is a
                <em>fixed cost per byte</em> of data published, paid by
                the Sequencer and passed on to users. It’s
                <em>independent</em> of the execution gas consumed by
                the transaction itself but scales with the transaction’s
                size in bytes (especially
                <code>calldata</code>).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Verification Fee:</strong> Covers the
                gas cost of verifying the ZK proof on L1. This is a
                <em>fixed or semi-fixed cost per batch/block</em> of
                transactions, amortized across all transactions in that
                batch. Aggregation (Section 4.4) is key to minimizing
                the per-transaction share.</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Overhead Burden:</strong> Simple
                transactions (e.g., ETH transfers) are dominated by L1
                DA/Verification costs. While their <em>execution</em> is
                cheap (21K gas), their <em>calldata</em> is relatively
                large (approx. 112 bytes for a basic transfer), leading
                to a high overhead ratio. On L1, the same transfer pays
                mostly for execution. Pre-EIP-4844, this meant simple
                transfers on early ZK-Rollups could sometimes cost
                <em>more</em> than on congested L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>EIP-4844 Blobs: The Game
                Changer:</strong> The Dencun upgrade (March 2024)
                introduced <strong>blobs</strong>, providing ~10-100x
                cheaper DA than calldata. This dramatically reduced the
                cost of data-heavy transactions and made simple
                transfers significantly cheaper on L2. However, the
                verification fee and Sequencer margin remain as fixed
                overheads per batch.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proving Costs and Sequencer
                Economics:</strong> The operational cost of generating
                the ZK proof (Section 4.3 - electricity, hardware
                depreciation, cloud costs) must be covered by the
                Sequencer via fees. While proving costs per transaction
                decrease with batch size and hardware advances, they
                represent a baseline cost absent on L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Variable L1 Gas Prices:</strong> The cost
                of DA and verification fluctuates with Ethereum L1 base
                fee. An L2 fee market must dynamically adjust to avoid
                operating at a loss during L1 spikes.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L2 Fee Market Dynamics:</strong> Unlike
                L1’s uniform auction, early ZK-EVM sequencers often used
                simplified fee models (e.g., first-price auction
                variants or fixed markups). This could lead to fee
                volatility or inefficiency compared to mature L1
                markets, though it converged towards L1-like models over
                time.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Data Compression:</strong> Techniques
                like Brotli or domain-specific compression (e.g., for

                Essential to amortize the fixed L1 verification cost
                over hundreds or thousands of transactions (Section
                4.4). Scroll and Polygon zkEVM achieved verification
                costs of 200K-500K gas for entire blocks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> GPUs,
                FPGAs, and eventually ASICs drove down the operational

                <li><p>This aimed to provide users with predictable fees
                mirroring L1 patterns. Projects like Taiko explored
                MEV-resistant fair ordering to mitigate negative fee
                market externalities.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Benchmarking and Transparency:</strong>
                Projects continuously published fee comparisons against
                L1 for standard transaction types (transfers, swaps, NFT
                mints) to demonstrate parity or superiority, especially
                post-EIP-4844. Tools like L2fees.info became vital
                references.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result by Mid-2024:</strong> For most common
                transactions (swaps, liquidity provision, NFT trades),
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs consistently achieved <strong>significant
                cost savings (often 5-10x cheaper) compared to average
                L1 fees</strong>, fulfilling the core scaling promise.
                Simple transfers, while vastly cheaper than pre-blob L2,
                could still have a higher <em>relative</em> overhead
                compared to their ultra-low L1 execution cost but were
                typically priced at a fraction of a cent. True parity in
                the <em>structure</em> of fees (execution vs. overhead)
                remained elusive for minimal transactions, but the
                absolute cost was low enough to be negligible for users.
                The economic value proposition was decisively

                curve math), efficient ZK circuit implementation
                requires careful optimization using techniques like

                (<code>floor(mult_complexity(max(base_len, modulus_len)) * max(adjusted_exp_len, 1)) / GQUADDIVISOR</code>).
                Proving variable-time exponentiation efficiently within

                </ol>
                <p>Smart contracts interact with blockchain context via
                specific opcodes. Type-2 ZK-EVMs must provide identical
                values:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Block Properties:</strong>
                <code>block.number</code> (L2 block number),
                <code>block.timestamp</code> (set by the Sequencer, must
                be &gt;= parent L1 timestamp and &lt;= current L1
                timestamp), <code>block.gaslimit</code> (usually set
                much higher than L1 or dynamically),
                <code>block.difficulty</code>/<code>block.prevrandao</code>
                (set to zero or a fixed value on L2, matching L1’s
                post-Merge behavior), <code>block.chainid</code> (the L2
                chain ID), <code>block.basefee</code> (if the L2
                implements an EIP-1559 fee market).</p></li>
                <li><p><code>COINBASE</code>: Typically set to the
                Sequencer’s address. While the value differs from L1,
                the <em>semantics</em> (the address receiving block
                rewards/fees) are preserved.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gas Price Oracles:</strong> Contracts
                relying on <code>GASPRICE</code> opcode or oracles like
                <code>gasprice.io</code> need consistent behavior. L2s
                provide their own gas price oracles via precompiles or
                standard contracts, returning the L2 base fee and
                priority fee components. The <em>meaning</em> (current
                gas price) is equivalent, even if the <em>value</em>
                differs from L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Accessing L1 State:</strong> While not
                direct EVM opcodes, canonical bridges often provide
                methods (via L2 precompiles or system contracts) to
                verify Merkle proofs about L1 state (e.g., token
                deposits, L1 message roots). The <em>mechanism</em>
                differs (L1 info is relayed, not directly accessible),
                but the <em>capability</em> to trustlessly verify L1
                state is functionally equivalent.</p></li>

                <p>The EVM specification isn’t always perfectly defined,
                and historical client behavior sometimes set de facto
                standards. Type-2 implementations had to navigate these
                carefully:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Transient Storage
                (<code>TLOAD</code>/<code>TSTORE</code> -
                EIP-1153):</strong> Added in Shanghai, these opcodes
                provide reentrancy-safe temporary storage. Proving their
                ephemeral nature (cleared after transaction) required
                careful circuit design to avoid leaking state. Ensuring
                identical behavior across calls within a transaction was
                critical.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><code>SELFDESTRUCT</code>
                Semantics:</strong> The exact timing of balance transfer
                and contract deletion, especially when the recipient is
                the self-destructing contract or a new contract created
                in the same transaction. Geth/Nethermind behavior had to
                be replicated precisely. Future deprecation (EIP-4758,
                EIP-6780) added complexity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gas Calculation Edge Cases:</strong>
                Precise gas metering for operations like
                <code>EXP</code> with exponent 0 or 1, <code>CALL</code>
                with zero value vs. non-zero value, memory expansion
                beyond <code>2^24</code> bytes (where gas overflows),
                and handling of the 63/64ths rule for <code>CALL</code>
                depth gas forwarding. Differential fuzzing was crucial
                here.</p></li>

                Distinguishing between <code>STOP</code>,
                <code>RETURN</code>, <code>REVERT</code>, and
                <code>INVALID</code> opcode behavior, and ensuring the
                correct gas refunds (or lack thereof) and state
                reversion occurred identically. Handling nested reverts
                across <code>DELEGATECALL</code> boundaries was
                particularly delicate.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Undefined Behavior:</strong> Situations
                not explicitly covered by the Yellow Paper but with
                established client behavior (e.g., handling extremely
                large shift values in
                <code>SHL</code>/<code>SHR</code>). Type-2 clients
                defaulted to replicating Geth’s behavior.</p></li>

                <p>Achieving equivalence in precompiles, system
                interactions, and edge cases was an ongoing process of
                refinement. Projects maintained public trackers (like
                Polygon’s “Journey to Full EVM Equivalence”) documenting
                resolved discrepancies. By mid-2024, the gap had
                narrowed significantly, with only the most obscure edge
                cases potentially exhibiting divergence. For the vast
                majority of applications, the environment was
                indistinguishable. However, a seamless developer

                when submitted to the actual ZK-EVM network. The failure
                wasn’t a contract revert, but a failure by the
                <em>prover</em> to generate a valid proof. This
                manifested cryptically:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Opaque Errors:</strong> Prover errors
                were often low-level and unhelpful: “Constraint
                unsatisfied in gate X at row Y,” “Witness generation
                failed,” or simply “Proof generation timed out.”
                Translating these into actionable insights for Solidity
                developers was extremely difficult.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Limited Traces:</strong> While the
                Sequencer/Executor knew the transaction failed, the
                detailed execution trace (which would show <em>why</em>
                it failed on the EVM level) was never generated or was
                incomplete because proving failed <em>during</em> trace
                processing. Developers lacked visibility into the
                execution state when the prover choked.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Causes:</strong> Proof failures could

                <li><p><strong>Circuit Bugs:</strong> An error in the ZK
                circuit implementation, failing to accept a

                <li><p><strong>Witness Generation Issues:</strong>

                <li><p><strong>Non-Determinism:</strong> Subtle
                differences between the local development EVM (e.g.,
                Hardhat) and the ZK-EVM’s Geth executor, causing a trace

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Enhanced Debug Modes:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Local Proving:</strong> Running a
                lightweight version of the ZK prover locally during
                development (e.g., Scroll’s <code>scroll-prover</code>
                tool, Polygon’s local setup). This allowed developers to
                generate proofs for their transactions <em>locally</em>
                and get more detailed errors in their familiar
                environment. Performance was slow but invaluable for
                debugging.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Verbose Prover Logging:</strong> Adding
                context-rich logging to the prover, mapping constraint
                failures back to specific EVM opcodes or execution steps
                when possible. Projects like Taiko invested heavily in
                more descriptive error messages.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Partial Witness Inspection:</strong>
                Tools allowing developers to dump and inspect portions
                of the witness data generated from the execution trace
                to identify anomalies.</p></li>

                transaction <em>only</em> through the Executor
                (bypassing proving) and outputting a detailed execution
                trace and final state. This confirmed whether the
                transaction was <em>semantically valid</em> on the
                ZK-EVM’s EVM, isolating proving issues.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trace Comparison Tools:</strong>
                Comparing the execution trace generated by the ZK-EVM
                Executor against a trace from a local Geth node running
                the same transaction. Differences pinpointed equivalence
                bugs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Improved Testnet Environments:</strong>
                Providing robust, stable testnets with enhanced logging

                <li><p><strong>Transaction Lifecycle Tracking:</strong>
                Block explorers showed transaction statuses like
                “Received by Sequencer,” “Executed,” “Proving,”
                “Proven,” and “Finalized on L1.” This was crucial for

                events and state from the ZK-EVM just like from
                L1.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Node APIs:</strong> ZK-EVM nodes exposed
                standard Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints
                (<code>eth_blockNumber</code>,
                <code>eth_getBalance</code>, <code>eth_call</code>,

                <p><strong>The State of DX by Mid-2024:</strong> The
                developer experience for <em>building</em> and
                <em>deploying</em> standard contracts on Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                was exceptionally smooth, matching L1 thanks to bytecode
                equivalence and tool compatibility. <em>Debugging
                proof-specific failures</em> remained the most
                significant friction point, requiring specialized
                knowledge and tools. However, concerted efforts on local
                proving, better error messages, and educational
                resources significantly lowered the barrier compared to
                the early, opaque days. As tooling matured and proving
                became more robust, this friction steadily decreased.
                The overall DX was demonstrably superior to less
                equivalent ZK-EVMs (Type 3/4) and Optimistic Rollups
                (with their delayed finality), validating the Type-2
                approach for mainstream developer adoption.</p>
                <p><strong>Transition:</strong> The rigorous pursuit of
                equivalence in execution, economics, and developer
                experience forms the bedrock of the Type-2 ZK-EVM’s
                value proposition. Yet, this value is only realized if
                the underlying system is secure. Having established
                <em>how</em> these systems operate equivalently, Section
                6 critically examines <em>how securely</em> they
                operate, dissecting the cryptographic guarantees,

                <p>The remarkable technical achievements of Type-2
                ZK-EVMs—their bytecode fidelity, gas cost parity, and
                developer-friendly environment—ultimately rest upon a
                foundational promise: the cryptographic inheritance of
                Ethereum’s security. This section shifts focus from
                operational equivalence to the bedrock question of
                trust, dissecting the intricate security model that
                enables users to transact on Layer 2 with confidence
                rivaling mainnet. While the previous sections detailed
                <em>how</em> these systems replicate Ethereum’s
                execution environment, we now scrutinize <em>how
                securely</em> they do so, examining the cryptographic
                guarantees, systemic vulnerabilities, and the delicate
                balance between mathematical certainty and real-world
                operational risks. The security of Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                represents not just a technical achievement but a
                philosophical commitment to preserving Ethereum’s
                trust-minimization ethos within a scaled ecosystem.</p>

                Inheriting Ethereum’s Security: Validity Proofs
                Explained</h3>
                <p>At its core, the security proposition of a Type-2
                ZK-EVM is elegantly simple yet revolutionary:
                <strong>only valid state transitions can be finalized on
                Ethereum L1</strong>. This guarantee is enforced not by
                social consensus or economic penalties, but by immutable
                cryptographic laws.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>The Core Cryptographic
                Guarantee:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> When the Sequencer
                submits a new state root (<code>S_new</code>) and
                accompanying ZK proof to the <strong>Verifier
                Contract</strong> on L1, the contract executes a
                mathematical verification algorithm. This algorithm
                cryptographically proves that:</li>
                </ul>
                <p><code>S_new = F(S_old, Batch)</code></p>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><code>S_old</code> is the previously accepted,
                valid state root (stored on L1).</p></li>
                <li><p><code>Batch</code> is the set of ordered
                transactions (whose data availability is secured via L1
                calldata/blobs).</p></li>
                <li><p><code>F</code> represents the <em>exact,
                deterministic rules of the EVM</em> as implemented by
                the Type-2 executor.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Implication:</strong> If the proof
                verifies successfully, it is computationally infeasible
                (based on current cryptographic assumptions) for
                <code>S_new</code> to represent any state other than the
                one resulting from applying <code>Batch</code> to
                <code>S_old</code> according to the EVM rules. Any
                attempt to finalize an invalid state (e.g., one that
                steals funds, mints unauthorized tokens, or corrupts
                contract storage) will cause the proof verification to
                fail, and the Verifier Contract will reject the state
                root update.</p></li>

                <ol start="2" type="1">
                <li><strong>Contrast with Optimistic Rollups
                (ORUs):</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The difference in security models between ZK-Rollups
                and ORUs is profound and has practical implications:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Fraud Proof Window vs. Instant
                Finality:</strong> ORUs assume all state transitions are
                valid by default. They rely on a <strong>challenge
                period</strong> (typically 7 days) during which any
                honest party can submit a <strong>fraud proof</strong>
                demonstrating an invalid transition. Funds cannot be
                withdrawn trustlessly until this window passes.
                <strong>Type-2 ZK-EVMs eliminate this window
                entirely.</strong> State roots are finalized on L1
                within minutes of proof generation, offering
                <strong>cryptographic finality</strong>. Withdrawals can
                be processed immediately after finality, as there’s no
                need to wait for potential challenges.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Trust Assumption:</strong> ORUs require
                at least one honest and economically incentivized actor
                to be vigilantly monitoring the chain and capable of
                submitting a fraud proof within the challenge window.
                Failure of this “liveness” assumption (e.g., due to
                apathy, complexity, or censorship) could allow invalid
                states to become permanent. <strong>ZK-Rollups remove
                this liveness requirement.</strong> Security relies
                solely on the soundness of the cryptographic proof
                system and the correct implementation of the Verifier
                Contract. Once a valid proof is accepted, the state
                transition is irreversible, regardless of participant
                vigilance.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> The 7-day
                withdrawal delay on ORUs like Optimism and Arbitrum
                represented a significant UX friction and capital
                inefficiency, hindering adoption for time-sensitive
                applications (e.g., arbitrage, treasury management). The
                near-instant finality of ZK-Rollups like Scroll and
                Polygon zkEVM provided a compelling advantage.
                Furthermore, the absence of a fraud proof mechanism
                simplified the protocol design and reduced the attack
                surface related to fraud proof construction and
                validation.</p></li>

                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Function:</strong> This on-chain smart
                contract is the ultimate arbiter. It contains the highly
                optimized verification algorithm specific to the ZK
                proof system used (e.g., Plonky2 for Polygon, Halo2 for
                Scroll). Its code is typically short, deterministic, and
                heavily audited.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Security Criticality:</strong> The entire
                security of the ZK-Rollup hinges on two properties of
                the Verifier Contract:</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><p><strong>Correctness:</strong> It must correctly
                implement the verification algorithm for the underlying
                proof system. A bug could allow an invalid proof to be
                accepted (catastrophic failure) or a valid proof to be
                rejected (liveness failure).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Soundness of the Proof System:</strong>
                The underlying cryptography (e.g., Plonky2, Halo2) must
                be sound. If the proof system itself has a fundamental
                flaw (e.g., a way to generate a “valid” proof for an
                invalid execution), the Verifier Contract, even if
                perfectly coded, becomes useless.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Audits and Formal Verification:</strong>
                Given its criticality, Verifier Contracts undergo
                extreme scrutiny:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Scroll (Halo2 Verifier):</strong> Audited
                multiple times by Zellic, Hexens, and Trail of Bits,
                focusing on elliptic curve arithmetic, pairing checks,
                and soundness of the circuit public inputs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon zkEVM (Plonky2
                Verifier):</strong> Audited by Hexens and Veridise,
                emphasizing FRI verification, recursive proof
                composition, and efficient field operations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> Projects
                like =nil; Foundation worked on formally verifying ZK
                verifier contracts using tools like Coq, though
                widespread adoption in production was still emerging by
                mid-2024.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Upgradability Risk:</strong> Most
                Verifier Contracts include upgradeability mechanisms
                controlled by a multi-signature wallet or DAO. While
                necessary for fixing bugs or improving efficiency, this
                introduces a centralization vector. A malicious or
                compromised upgrade could introduce a backdoored
                verifier. Mitigations include timelocks (e.g., 7-30
                days) and progressive decentralization of the upgrade
                keys.</p></li>

                <p>The cryptographic finality offered by validity proofs
                is the Type-2 ZK-EVM’s superpower. However, this
                superpower rests upon specific mathematical assumptions
                and systemic implementations that warrant careful
                examination.</p>

                <p>Beneath the abstraction of “cryptographic security”
                lie concrete mathematical problems and implementation
                choices, each carrying its own trust profile.
                Understanding these assumptions is crucial for
                evaluating the true robustness of a ZK-EVM’s security
                guarantee.</p>

                <li><strong>Security of Underlying
                Primitives:</strong></li>

                <li><p><strong>Elliptic Curve Cryptography
                (ECC):</strong> SNARKs like Halo2 (used by Scroll,
                Taiko) rely heavily on the security of specific elliptic
                curves:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>BN254 (Barreto-Naehrig 254-bit):</strong>
                Historically dominant due to efficient pairings.
                However, it has a relatively small security level (~100
                bits) by modern standards and is potentially vulnerable
                to future algorithmic advances or specialized hardware.
                Its use in the Perpetual Powers of Tau ceremony also
                carries a residual trusted setup risk.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>BLS12-381:</strong> Increasingly adopted
                (e.g., Ethereum’s consensus layer) for its higher
                security level (~120-130 bits) and better performance
                characteristics. Scroll and others migrated towards
                BLS12-381 variants for stronger security
                guarantees.</p></li>

                breakthrough solving ECDLP (e.g., via a quantum
                computer) would break these SNARKs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Hash Functions:</strong> STARKs (Plonky2,
                Boojum) and the Fiat-Shamir transform rely on
                collision-resistant hash functions:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Keccak-256:</strong> Ethereum’s native
                hash (used in <code>KECCAK</code> opcode and often in
                STARKs).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Poseidon:</strong> A ZK-friendly hash
                designed for efficiency in arithmetic circuits, used in
                many lookup arguments and Plonky2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>SHA-256, Blake2s:</strong> Also used in
                various components.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Security relies on
                the <strong>collision resistance</strong> and
                <strong>pre-image resistance</strong> of these hashes. A
                practical collision attack on Keccak or Poseidon would
                be catastrophic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fiat-Shamir Heuristic:</strong> This
                technique converts interactive proofs (where prover and
                verifier exchange messages) into non-interactive proofs
                (a single message from prover to verifier) by replacing
                the verifier’s random challenges with a hash of the
                transcript so far. Its security relies on modeling the
                hash function as a <strong>Random Oracle</strong> – an
                idealization where the hash output is perfectly random
                and unpredictable. While proven secure in this idealized
                model, real-world hash functions are not perfect random
                oracles, introducing a subtle theoretical
                assumption.</p></li>

                <p>This remains one of the most debated aspects in

                Ceremony</strong> to generate public parameters (often
                called the Common Reference String or CRS). If the
                “toxic waste” (secret randomness used during setup) is
                not destroyed, a malicious actor could generate fake
                proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation: Perpetual Powers of
                Tau.</strong> This ongoing, universal ceremony
                (coordinated by entities like the Ethereum Foundation)
                involves thousands of participants contributing
                randomness. Each participant sequentially adds their
                layer of secrecy, and the final output is used by
                <em>multiple</em> projects (Scroll, Taiko, PSE zkEVM).
                The security relies on at least <em>one</em> participant
                being honest and destroying their toxic waste. The scale
                and public nature make collusion or compromise extremely
                difficult, effectively minimizing the trust assumption
                to near-negligible levels for many. However, the
                <em>theoretical</em> risk persists.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transparent Proof Systems (STARKs -
                Plonky2, Boojum):</strong> Systems like Plonky2 (Polygon
                zkEVM) and Boojum (zkSync) require <strong>no trusted
                setup</strong>. They rely solely on cryptographic hashes
                (collision resistance), which are considered more robust
                against future attacks and eliminate this specific trust
                vector. This aligns strongly with Ethereum’s

                transparency and post-quantum resilience of STARKs are
                increasingly seen as worth the trade-off. Polygon’s

                “Redshift-style”) or other PQ-compatible backends. The

                ZK-EVM depends critically on mitigating centralization
                risks inherent in its initial operational phases.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Sequencer Centralization: The Single Point
                of Control (and Failure):</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Role:</strong> The Sequencer orders
                transactions, constructs blocks, executes them (or
                triggers execution), and posts data/proofs to L1.
                Initial implementations universally relied on a
                <strong>single, centralized Sequencer</strong> operated
                by the project team.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Risks:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Censorship:</strong> The Sequencer can
                arbitrarily delay or exclude specific transactions
                (e.g., those interacting with a sanctioned protocol or
                originating from a blacklisted address). Users have no
                recourse other than to wait for permissionless
                alternatives.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV):</strong>
                The Sequencer has a privileged position to view the
                mempool and front-run, back-run, or sandwich user
                transactions, extracting significant value. Centralized
                MEV capture contradicts Ethereum’s ethos and harms
                users.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Downtime:</strong> If the centralized
                Sequencer experiences technical failure or is targeted
                by a DDoS attack, the entire L2 chain halts. No
                transactions can be processed until the Sequencer
                recovers or a failover mechanism activates.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Data Withholding (Theoretical):</strong>
                While the ZK proof ensures <em>correctness</em> of what
                is <em>posted</em>, a malicious Sequencer could
                theoretically withhold transaction data <em>or</em> the
                ZK proof itself, preventing state finalization on L1 and
                freezing withdrawals. However, users could force-include
                transactions via L1 if the Sequencer censors or
                withholds data (though this is expensive and
                slow).</p></li>

                Decentralization:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Permissioned PoS Sequencing:</strong>
                Transitioning to a set of approved, staked sequencers
                (e.g., Polygon zkEVM’s planned “Phase 2”
                decentralization). This improves liveness and censorship
                resistance but may not fully mitigate MEV or collusion
                risks. Projects like Astria propose shared sequencing
                layers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Permissionless PoS Sequencing w/
                DAS:</strong> A more robust model where anyone can stake
                to become a sequencer. Requires a decentralized
                <strong>Data Availability Sampling (DAS)</strong> scheme
                (similar to Ethereum Danksharding) so that sequencers
                don’t need to store the entire L2 state. Full
                implementation awaited Ethereum’s Danksharding
                progress.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation:</strong> Techniques like
                <strong>Fair Sequencing Services (FSS)</strong> or
                integration with <strong>SUAVE</strong> (Single Unifying
                Auction for Value Expression) aim to prevent sequencers
                from exploiting their ordering power. Encrypted mempools
                (e.g., using threshold encryption) are another research
                area.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Force Inclusion Mechanisms:</strong>
                Standardized L1 smart contracts allowing users to
                directly submit transactions if censored by the
                Sequencer for a prolonged period (e.g., 24 hours),
                ensuring liveness guarantees. Incorporated in designs
                like Arbitrum and planned by ZK-EVMs.</p></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Generating ZK proofs
                for full EVM blocks is computationally intensive,
                requiring specialized hardware (high-end GPUs, FPGAs,
                ASICs). The high capital and operational costs create a
                significant barrier to entry.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Concentration of proving
                power in the hands of the core project team or a few
                large entities. While a single honest prover is
                sufficient for security (unlike PoW/PoS), centralization
                creates risks:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Liveness Risk:</strong> If the dominant
                prover(s) fail, proof generation halts, blocking state
                finality on L1 and freezing withdrawals.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Economic Risk:</strong> Provers could
                extract monopolistic rents, increasing transaction
                fees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Coordination Risk:</strong> Upgrades or
                bug fixes become dependent on a small group.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Censorship (Indirect):</strong> While
                provers don’t control transaction inclusion, a
                centralized prover ecosystem could refuse to process
                proofs for transactions from certain addresses if
                coerced.</p></li>

                Decentralization:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Proof Aggregation + Recursion:</strong>
                Enables breaking block proofs into smaller chunks (e.g.,
                per transaction or shard). Smaller chunks can be proven
                by less powerful machines (consumer GPUs, even CPUs
                eventually). Aggregator nodes then combine these proofs
                recursively. This is the most promising path (actively
                pursued by Scroll, Polygon, Taiko).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralized Proving Networks
                (DPNs):</strong> Marketplaces or protocols (e.g.,
                Gevulot, Aleo) where provers compete to generate proofs
                for batches, submitting bids. The Sequencer (or a
                dedicated coordinator) selects the cheapest or fastest
                valid proof. Requires robust slashing mechanisms for
                faulty proofs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>ASIC/FPGA Commoditization:</strong>
                Widespread availability of affordable ZK-accelerator
                hardware lowers the barrier for small-scale provers to
                participate. Companies like Ingonyama and Cysic aim to
                drive this.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Optimistic or Lazy Proving:</strong>
                Models like Taiko’s “Based Contestable Rollup” allow
                blocks to be proposed <em>without</em> an immediate
                proof, relying on a challenge period if fraud is
                suspected. While reducing the <em>immediate</em> need
                for massive proving power, it sacrifices the pure
                ZK-Rollup’s instant finality benefit. Used primarily as
                a transitional mechanism.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Timelocks:</strong> Mandating a delay
                (e.g., 7-30 days) between an upgrade proposal and its
                execution. This allows users and the community time to
                scrutinize changes and exit funds if necessary. Widely
                adopted (e.g., Scroll’s 10-day timelock).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Multi-sig Governance:</strong> Increasing
                the number and diversity of key holders (e.g., 5/8 or
                8/12 multi-sigs involving core team, investors, and
                community representatives). Reduces single points of
                failure but doesn’t eliminate collusion risk.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Progressive Decentralization:</strong>
                Transferring upgrade keys to a well-established DAO over
                time, governed by a decentralized token. The timeline
                and robustness of this process vary significantly

                <li><p><strong>Dependency:</strong> Type-2 ZK-EVMs rely
                entirely on Ethereum L1 for data availability. The
                transaction data (batch data) <em>must</em> be published
                to L1 (calldata or blobs) for the system to be
                verifiable and for users to reconstruct state.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Risks:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L1 Consensus Failure:</strong> If

                Byzantine attack causing finality reversion), the
                security of the L2 state derived from that L1 data is
                compromised. The ZK-Rollup inherits Ethereum’s consensus
                security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Blob Pruning:</strong> EIP-4844 blobs are
                only guaranteed to be available for ~18 days. While node
                operators are expected to retain them longer via
                peer-to-peer networks (“blob archivers”), a widespread
                failure to do so could theoretically prevent
                reconstructing old state after this period. Tools like
                <strong>EigenDA</strong> or <strong>Celestia</strong>
                could act as supplementary DA layers, but this
                introduces new trust assumptions and is not yet standard
                in Type-2 ZK-EVMs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Calldata Cost Spikes:</strong> While
                mitigated by blobs, reliance on L1 for DA means costs
                are still subject to Ethereum gas price volatility.
                Sequencers must manage this risk in their fee
                models.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> The security model
                inherently ties the ZK-Rollup to Ethereum’s security.
                Using Ethereum for DA is currently the most secure and
                decentralized option. The risk of widespread blob data
                loss is considered low due to economic incentives for

                unparalleled execution integrity, but practical
                liveness, censorship resistance, and permissionless

                <p>While inheriting Ethereum’s application risks, Type-2
                ZK-EVMs introduce novel potential vulnerabilities:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Circuit Implementation Bugs:</strong>
                Flaws in the ZK circuits mapping the EVM could lead to
                <strong>soundness errors</strong>. This means a
                malicious prover <em>could</em> generate a valid proof
                for an <em>invalid</em> execution trace. While audits
                focus heavily on preventing this, the complexity of EVM
                circuits makes it a non-zero risk. A soundness bug would
                be catastrophic, allowing fake state transitions.
                Continuous fuzzing (like differential fuzzing against
                L1) and formal verification of circuits are critical
                defenses. The PSE <code>zkevm-circuits</code> project
                serves as a reference to reduce this risk.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Prover Side-Channels:</strong>
                Theoretical vulnerabilities where the <em>process</em>
                of proof generation (e.g., timing, power consumption)
                could leak information about the private witness data
                (transaction details). Mature ZK implementations
                incorporate mitigations like constant-time
                algorithms.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>L2-Specific Oracle Risks:</strong>
                Applications relying on price or data oracles need to
                ensure these oracles are available and secure <em>on the
                L2</em>. A compromised oracle <em>on L2</em> (e.g., due
                to sequencer manipulation or a buggy L2 oracle contract)
                can lead to exploits just like on L1. Decentralized
                oracle networks (Chainlink, Pyth) had to deploy and
                secure their services on each ZK-EVM chain
                individually.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Front-running on L2:</strong> While MEV
                exists on L1, the centralized sequencer in early ZK-EVMs
                created a single, powerful entity capable of maximal
                front-running. Fair sequencing solutions are crucial to
                mitigate this novel centralization of MEV
                extraction.</p></li>

                <p>The security landscape of Type-2 ZK-EVMs is thus
                multifaceted. The cryptographic core provides
                unprecedented guarantees of execution correctness,
                effectively eliminating whole classes of L1 consensus
                and execution client bugs. However, it does not absolve
                developers of secure coding practices, does not
                eliminate bridge risks, and introduces subtle new
                concerns around circuit implementation and proving
                centralization. The true security posture emerges from
                the interplay of robust cryptography, careful system
                design, diligent operational practices, and the
                relentless auditing and decentralization of critical

                <p>The generation of a zero-knowledge proof remains the
                most imposing performance barrier for Type-2 ZK-EVMs.
                While cryptographic finality offers profound security
                advantages over optimistic rollups, the latency between
                transaction execution and proof generation creates
                operational friction and centralization pressures. This

                Halo2-based prover required over 15 minutes to prove a
                block containing a complex Curve.fi stablecoin swap. The
                operation involved intensive <code>KECCAK</code> hashing
                (for storage slot proofs) and <code>BIGMOD</code>
                operations within the Curve math, overwhelming GPU

                inclusion proof</strong> within the ZK circuit. This
                involves:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Trie Traversal:</strong> Proving the path
                from the state root down to the specific storage slot
                for each access. A single <code>SLOAD</code> can
                generate <strong>10,000 - 100,000 constraints</strong>,
                depending on trie depth and optimization.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Witness Blowup:</strong> The “witness”
                data needed for the prover includes all sibling nodes
                along the MPT path for <em>every</em> storage access.
                For a contract with frequently accessed slots (e.g., a
                DEX’s liquidity pool reserves), this witness data
                becomes enormous, straining memory and I/O during proof
                generation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Solution - Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs)
                &amp; Caching:</strong> While Type-2 mandates the

                the <em>internal</em> representation for proving can be
                optimized. Using SMTs internally simplifies proofs
                (constant depth) and reduces sibling node data.
                <strong>Witness Caching</strong> stores proofs for
                recently accessed slots, avoiding redundant traversal
                proofs within a batch. Polygon zkEVM’s zkProver

                Generating the execution trace and witness for a
                transaction touching thousands of storage slots (e.g.,
                sweeping many NFT trades) requires significant RAM
                (hundreds of GBs) and fast SSD storage, creating

                <li><p><strong>Solution - State Diffs &amp; Incremental
                Witnesses:</strong> Instead of generating a witness from

                state” and apply only the <em>differences</em> (state
                diffs) caused by the current batch. Scroll utilizes
                incremental witness generation, drastically reducing

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Upgradable Circuits (with

                definitions and the Verifier Contract are made
                upgradeable via a timelocked governance mechanism
                (multisig/DAO). When Ethereum upgrades, the core team
                develops new circuits, undergoes audits, and deploys
                them via governance. <strong>Trade-off:</strong>
                Maintains equivalence but reintroduces
                centralization/trust during upgrades and requires
                complex coordination.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Circuit Modularity:</strong> Architecting
                circuits as replaceable components. A “State Access
                Module” could be swapped from an MPT-prover to a
                Verkle-prover. A “Precompile Module” could be added or
                updated independently. Scroll’s
                <code>zkevm-circuits</code> and Polygon’s zkASM prover
                emphasize this modularity.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>VM Abstraction:</strong> Projects like
                Risc Zero or the zkLLVM approach demonstrate a path
                where the ZK-EVM circuit proves execution of a simpler,
                stable instruction set (e.g., RISC-V or LLVM IR). An
                unmodified Ethereum client (Geth) compiled to this
                target would run <em>within</em> this ZK-VM. Ethereum
                upgrades only require recompiling Geth, not redesigning
                the core ZK circuit. <strong>Challenge:</strong> Proving
                the compilation is faithful and maintaining performance
                is difficult for Type-2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>“Functional Equivalence” over Bytecode
                Equivalence (Controversial):</strong> Some argue future

                over identical <em>bytecode execution steps</em>. This

                <li><p><strong>AggLayer:</strong> Shared ZK proof
                aggregation and cross-chain messaging hub, enabling
                atomic composability across CDK chains. By Q2 2024, 15+
                chains (including Immutable zkEVM Gaming, Astar zkEVM)

                9: Controversies, Debates, and the Future of
                Equivalence</h2>
                <p>The explosive ecosystem growth chronicled in Section
                8 – with billions in TVL migrating to Scroll and Polygon
                zkEVM, enterprises leveraging their unique
                privacy-auditability balance, and novel DeFi primitives
                flourishing – validated Type-2 ZK-EVMs as transformative
                scaling infrastructure. Yet, this very success
                intensified fundamental debates simmering beneath the
                surface. The relentless pursuit of Ethereum equivalence,
                while delivering unparalleled developer adoption and
                security inheritance, forced confrontations with
                practical constraints and philosophical divergences. Was
                the purity of bytecode-level fidelity a sustainable
                ideal, or a noble but ultimately impractical pursuit?
                Could systems founded on computationally intensive
                cryptography ever achieve Ethereum’s decentralization
                ethos? And how would these cryptographic marvels coexist
                with alternative scaling visions? This section dissects
                the pivotal controversies shaping the next evolution of
                ZK-EVMs, revealing a landscape where technological
                idealism collides with engineering pragmatism,
                decentralization dreams grapple with hardware realities,
                and the very definition of “Ethereum equivalence” faces
                an uncertain future.</p>

                Type-2 vs. Type-3: The Pragmatism vs. Purity Debate</h3>
                <p>Vitalik Buterin’s typology provided crucial
                conceptual clarity, but it also drew battle lines
                between competing philosophies of ZK-EVM implementation.
                The tension between uncompromising equivalence (Type-2)
                and pragmatic optimization (Type-3) became the defining
                ideological rift of 2023-2024, playing out in technical
                compromises, project roadmaps, and developer
                allegiances.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>The Type-3 Argument: “Good Enough”
                Compatibility &amp; Proving Efficiency:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Advocates, exemplified by <strong>Polygon zkEVM’s
                initial approach</strong> and projects like
                <strong>zkSync Era</strong> (before Boojum), emphasized
                that <em>absolute</em> bytecode equivalence imposed
                unacceptable performance penalties. Their pragmatic
                stance argued:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Proving Speed is Paramount:</strong>
                Minor deviations from L1 gas costs or edge-case behavior
                were tolerable if they enabled significantly faster
                proving times and lower costs. Polygon zkEVM’s early use
                of <strong>zkASM</strong> allowed them to bypass the
                most expensive EVM opcode emulations, achieving 2-3x
                faster proving than early Type-2 contenders for complex
                blocks. This translated directly to better user
                experience (faster finality) and lower fees.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Developer Friction is
                Overstated:</strong> Most dApps, they argued, don’t rely
                on obscure edge cases or exact gas costs beyond core
                functionality. Tools like recompilers (e.g., zkSync’s
                <code>zksolc</code>) or slight VM modifications could
                achieve “effective equivalence” for 99% of use cases
                without demanding unmodified bytecode. The rapid growth
                of zkSync’s ecosystem, despite being Type-4
                (language-level equivalence), was cited as
                proof.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The 80/20 Rule:</strong> Optimizing for
                the most common operations (<code>ADD</code>,
                <code>MUL</code>, <code>SSTORE</code>,
                <code>CALL</code>) and accepting slight divergence on
                rarely used opcodes (<code>SELFDESTRUCT</code>,
                <code>PC</code>, exotic precompiles) was a rational
                engineering trade-off. Polygon’s “Journey to Full
                Equivalence” blog series explicitly framed their initial
                Type-3 state as a deliberate stepping stone.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> Polygon zkEVM initially
                implemented <code>KECCAK</code> with a slight gas cost
                variance (within 5%) compared to L1. While breaking
                strict equivalence, it avoided the massive circuit
                complexity of a perfect emulation, accelerating proofs
                for hash-heavy applications like Uniswap V3 position
                management.</p></li>

                <ol start="2" type="1">
                <li><strong>The Type-2 Rebuttal: Principle, Security,
                and Ecosystem Trust:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Champions like <strong>Scroll</strong> and
                <strong>Taiko</strong> countered that compromise on
                equivalence was a slippery slope undermining the core
                value proposition:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Security Through Familiarity:</strong>
                Identical bytecode execution meant contracts <em>behaved
                exactly as audited on L1</em>. Any divergence, however
                minor, introduced risk. A notorious incident on a Type-3
                chain (non-Type-2) in early 2024 involved a governance
                proposal failing due to subtle differences in gas refund
                behavior during a complex <code>DELEGATECALL</code>
                chain, freezing $15M temporarily. While resolved, it
                validated Type-2 proponents’ warnings.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Principle of Least Surprise:</strong>
                Developers should not need to re-audit contracts or
                anticipate subtle L2-specific behaviors. Uniswap’s
                seamless Scroll deployment contrasted sharply with the
                need for custom compilers and gas adjustments on less
                equivalent chains. “It either works exactly like
                mainnet, or it doesn’t. There’s no safe ‘mostly’,”
                argued Scroll co-founder Sandy Peng.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Long-Term Maintainability:</strong>
                Type-2 ensured automatic compatibility with <em>all</em>
                existing and future Ethereum tooling, debuggers, and
                indexers without adaptation layers. Type-3 systems
                required perpetual maintenance to track Ethereum
                upgrades and adjust their divergences, creating
                technical debt.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Performance Gap Closes:</strong>
                Advocates pointed to rapid advancements – FPGA/ASIC
                acceleration, LogUp lookups, and recursive aggregation –
                that narrowed the performance gap. By mid-2024, Scroll’s
                Type-2 proving times for common transactions were within
                20% of Polygon’s Type-3 times, eroding the pragmatist’s
                speed advantage.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="3" type="1">
                <li><strong>Convergence or Divergence? The Mid-2024
                Landscape:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The debate evolved from a binary choice to a spectrum
                of implementation strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Polygon’s Pivot Towards Type-2:</strong>
                Driven by developer demand and the narrowing performance
                gap, Polygon zkEVM systematically eliminated deviations
                throughout 2023-2024. By Q2 2024, they announced
                achieving <strong>full bytecode equivalence</strong>,
                validating core EVM instructions, precompiles, gas
                metering, and system calls. Their journey demonstrated
                that Type-3 <em>could</em> be a viable path <em>to</em>
                Type-2.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>zkSync’s Type-4 Stance:</strong> Matter
                Labs doubled down on their custom VM approach (Type-4),
                arguing that superior performance and features like
                native account abstraction offered more value than
                strict equivalence. Their ecosystem thrived on novel
                applications less tied to Ethereum’s legacy.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Hybrid Approach:</strong> Emerging
                frameworks like <strong>Kakarot</strong> (a Type-2/3
                zkEVM written in Cairo, running on Starknet’s Type-4
                zkVM) explored layering equivalence levels. Core EVM
                opcodes could be Type-2 equivalent, while the execution
                environment or state model might be optimized
                (Type-3).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Developer Vote:</strong> The market
                increasingly favored equivalence. The Electric Capital
                survey revealed 78% of developers deploying multi-chain
                dApps prioritized Type-2 ZK-EVMs for their
                Ethereum-aligned deployments, reserving Type-3/4 for
                experimental or application-specific chains.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The “purity vs. pragmatism” debate ultimately
                reinforced the value of equivalence. While Type-3 served
                as a crucial stepping stone, the industry trajectory
                leaned decisively towards Type-2 as the gold standard
                for general-purpose, security-critical scaling, proving
                that performance compromises could be overcome without
                sacrificing fidelity.</p>

                The Centralization Dilemma: Can ZK-EVMs Truly
                Decentralize?</h3>
                <p>The cryptographic magic of validity proofs guarantees
                execution integrity, but it does not inherently create
                permissionless, censorship-resistant networks. The
                specter of centralization haunted early Type-2 ZK-EVMs,
                manifesting in three critical bottlenecks: the
                sequencer, the prover, and governance. The question
                loomed: could these systems, born in the labs of
                well-funded teams, evolve to embody Ethereum’s
                decentralized ethos?</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Sequencer Centralization: The Censorship and
                MEV Nexus:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>The Single Point of Failure:</strong>
                Initial mainnet launches (Scroll, March 2024; Polygon
                zkEVM, March 2023) relied solely on centralized
                sequencers operated by the core teams. This granted them
                immense power:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Transaction Censorship:</strong> The
                ability to exclude transactions based on origin,
                destination, or content. While no widespread censorship
                occurred, the <em>capability</em> conflicted with
                Ethereum’s values. A testnet incident on a different
                ZK-Rollup in late 2023 demonstrated how a sequencer
                could block transactions interacting with a specific
                DeFi protocol.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>MEV Extraction Monopoly:</strong>
                Centralized sequencers became the ultimate MEV cartels.
                Polygon’s sequencer captured an estimated $2.8M in MEV
                in its first six months, primarily through front-running
                large DEX trades. Community backlash was swift and
                severe.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Liveness Risk:</strong> Technical
                failures in Scroll’s sequencer in April 2024 halted the
                chain for 3 hours, freezing millions in DeFi
                positions.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Paths to
                Decentralization:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Permissioned PoS Pools
                (Emerging):</strong> Polygon zkEVM implemented Phase 1
                decentralization in Q2 2024: a set of ~20 approved,
                staked (MATIC/POL) sequencers selected via governance
                vote. While improving liveness and reducing single-point
                censorship risk, it remained vulnerable to collusion and
                governance attacks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Shared Sequencing (Astria,
                Espresso):</strong> Projects building decentralized
                sequencing layers gained traction. Astria’s “shared
                sequencer” network, adopted by a Scroll Hyperbridge (L3)
                in May 2024, allowed multiple rollups to share a
                decentralized set of sequencers (validators), improving
                censorship resistance and enabling atomic cross-rollup
                composability. Transactions were ordered fairly before
                being routed to individual rollup provers.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Permissionless PoS + DAS (The
                Horizon):</strong> The endgame requires coupling
                permissionless sequencer staking with Ethereum’s
                <strong>Danksharding</strong> (or equivalent off-chain
                DA like Celestia with <strong>Data Availability Sampling
                - DAS</strong>). Sequencers wouldn’t need the full
                state, only the data for the blocks they produce. This
                remained in active R&amp;D but was likely years away for
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>The GPU/FPGA/ASIC Oligopoly:</strong>
                Generating ZK proofs for full EVM blocks demanded
                specialized, expensive hardware. By mid-2024, only a
                handful of entities – the core project teams,
                specialized proving services (e.g., =nil; Foundation),
                and cloud providers (AWS, GCP with ZK-accelerated
                instances) – possessed the resources to run production
                provers. This created risks:</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Recursive Proof Aggregation:</strong> The
                most promising path. Projects like
                <strong>Taiko</strong> and <strong>Scroll</strong>
                aggressively developed architectures where smaller
                proofs (e.g., per transaction or shard) could be
                generated by consumer-grade hardware (even laptops).
                Aggregators then combined these proofs recursively.
                Taiko’s “Based Contestable Rollup” model allowed
                permissionless participation in proving small
                chunks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Decentralized Proving Markets
                (DPMs):</strong> Platforms like <strong>Risc Zero’s
                Bonsai</strong> and <strong>Gevulot</strong> created
                open markets where provers bid to generate proofs.
                Scroll began routing portions of its proving workload
                (e.g., Keccak-heavy segments) to Bonsai in Q2 2024.
                Staking and slashing ensured honest

                <p>Bytecode equivalence is Type-2’s defining feature,
                but Ethereum’s relentless evolution threatens to turn
                this strength into a liability. Future upgrades,
                particularly Verkle Trees and EOF, demand fundamental
                changes to how state is accessed and code is executed,
                posing existential questions about the long-term

                <p>Faced with these upheavals, some architects proposed

                consumption) over identical <em>internal execution
                steps</em>. A Verkle-based ZK-EVM could implement
                <code>SLOAD</code> using a Verkle proof internally but
                ensure the gas cost and result match the Ethereum

                for dApps (contracts behave as expected).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> Breaks the

                burden (dApps must verify functional equivalence, not

                Architectures like <strong>Polygon CDK</strong> and

                to swap state proof implementations. Replacing an MPT
                state module with a Verkle state module becomes a

                Projects like <strong>PSE’s zkEVM Initiative</strong>

                from Ethereum’s executable formal specifications (using
                tools like K Framework). This could theoretically

                Framing ZK-EVMs akin to execution clients (Geth,

                Polygon, Reth-ZK) could implement the same Ethereum
                specification, potentially using different internal
                proving strategies, as long as they produced valid state

                Verkle and EOF pose monumental challenges, the
                commitment of major teams and the rise of modular
                designs suggest Type-2 equivalence can survive – but it

                Nitro’s near-perfect Geth parity, honed over years,

                <p>The competitive landscape revealed a nuanced future:
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs became the preferred destination for
                high-value, security-sensitive DeFi and institutional
                activity; ORUs maintained strongholds in established
                ecosystems and applications less sensitive to withdrawal
                delays; Validiums dominated high-throughput niches; and
                ZK-powered interoperability layers wove them into a
                cohesive “modular monolith.” Ethereum scaling was no
                longer a race to a single solution, but a symphony of
                specialized layers orchestrated by zero-knowledge
                proofs.</p>

                Cutting-Edge Research Directions</h3>
                <p>The relentless pursuit of efficiency, scalability,
                and robustness fuels a vibrant ecosystem of research,
                pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with ZK
                cryptography and EVM equivalence. Several frontiers
                promise revolutionary advancements:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>The Hardware Revolution: Specialization
                Unleashed:</strong></li>

                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>GPU Optimization Maturity:</strong>
                Frameworks like <strong>CUDA-ZK</strong> (Nvidia) and
                <strong>MetalZK</strong> (Apple) are squeezing maximum
                performance from existing GPU architectures. Techniques
                like fused kernel operations for MSM/NTT and optimized
                memory access patterns yield 30-50% speedups without new
                silicon. Projects like <strong>Scroll</strong>
                collaborate closely with Nvidia, feeding real-world
                ZK-EVM workloads back into driver
                optimizations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>FPGA Proliferation:</strong> Platforms
                like <strong>Cysic’s Fenix</strong> and
                <strong>Ingonyama’s Icicle</strong> transition from
                bespoke installations to cloud-accessible services (AWS
                FPGA instances, decentralized networks like
                <strong>Gevulot</strong>). Standardized interfaces
                (e.g., based on <strong>eBPF</strong>) allow ZK-EVM
                provers to dynamically offload MSM and NTT workloads,
                achieving 5-10x cost efficiency over pure GPU setups.
                Polygon zkEVM’s integration with Cysic FPGAs became a
                production benchmark.</p></li>

                the transition from prototypes to tape-outs:</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cysic’s 5nm “Zeus” Chip:</strong> Focused
                on parallel MSM acceleration, specifically optimized for
                BLS12-381 and BN254 curves prevalent in Halo2 and
                Plonkish systems. Projected for sampling late 2024,
                targeting integration into Scroll and Taiko provers by

                multi-function accelerator handling Poseidon hashing
                (critical for STARKs/Plonky2) and MSMs. Their “Polar
                Bear” prototype demonstrated 100x energy efficiency per
                MSM operation vs. high-end GPUs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> ASICs promise to slash
                proving times for complex EVM blocks (10-15M gas) from
                minutes to <strong>seconds</strong> and reduce
                operational costs to <strong>cents per block</strong>,
                fundamentally altering the economics and feasibility of
                decentralized proving networks. The first production
                ASIC-integrated Type-2 provers are expected by late
                2025.</p></li>

                DeFi protocol using a price oracle whose <em>entire
                inference run</em> (e.g., processing market data with a
                neural net) is proven correct by a ZK co-processor
                before submission. <strong>Worldcoin</strong> utilizes
                custom ZK-circuits for its iris-code verification,

                The Path to Decentralization and “Type 1-ness”</h3>
                <p>The cryptographic brilliance of Type-2 ZK-EVMs
                remains hamstrung without achieving Ethereum’s core
                ethos of permissionless participation and censorship
                resistance. The journey towards true decentralization –
                “Type 1-ness” – involves dismantling the sequencer and
                prover bottlenecks:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Decentralizing the Sequencer: Beyond
                Permissioned PoS:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <ul>

                Solutions like <strong>Astria</strong> and
                <strong>Espresso</strong> move beyond single-chain PoS

                <li><p><strong>Atomic Cross-Rollup
                Composability:</strong> Transactions spanning different
                ZK-EVMs (e.g., swap on Scroll, deposit result on Polygon
                CDK chain) are ordered together atomically.
                <strong>Polygon’s AggLayer</strong> achieves this via
                unified ZK proofs, while Astria provides the ordering
                foundation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Censorship Resistance:</strong> A large,
                diverse set of sequencer operators (validators) makes
                censorship significantly harder. Astria’s testnet
                demonstrated robust liveness under simulated

                <li><p><strong>MEV Mitigation:</strong> Shared

                sequencers to propose blocks without needing to store
                the entire L2 state history – they only need the data
                for their proposed block, which is made available via

                ordering transactions and posting data
                commitments/proofs. Malicious behavior (censorship, data
                withholding) is slashable. <strong>The Scroll

                Vision:</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>The most radical long-term vision involves
                integrating a ZK-EVM directly into Ethereum’s consensus
                layer:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Instead of a separate
                L2 rollup, Ethereum validators themselves would run a
                ZK-EVM prover (or verify proofs generated by specialized
                provers) to validate execution of Ethereum L1 blocks.
                Validity proofs become the primary mechanism for block
                verification, replacing the current “execute and verify”
                model.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Eliminates the
                separation between L1 and L2, maximizing security and
                value accrual to ETH. Achieves the purest form of
                scaling inheriting Ethereum’s full trust model.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Immense technical
                complexity (proving full L1 blocks fast enough),
                hardware requirements for validators (initially),
                governance around standardizing the ZK-EVM
                circuit.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Pathways:</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>“Type 1.5” - Enshrined Rollup:</strong> A
                hybrid where Ethereum consensus validates ZK proofs for
                <em>bundles</em> of transactions (like rollup blocks)
                posted to L1, effectively making Ethereum its own
                ZK-Rollup. <strong>Proto-Danksharding
                (EIP-4844)</strong> was a prerequisite step.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Full Enshrinement:</strong> Validators
                run light clients that only verify ZK proofs of block
                validity, drastically reducing their computational load.
                Requires massive proving efficiency gains and
                decentralized proving.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Current State:</strong> Actively
                researched by the <strong>Ethereum Foundation
                (EF)</strong> and <strong>PSE team</strong>. Vitalik
                Buterin’s “Endgame” posts outline this vision. Realistic
                timelines likely extend beyond 2030, but it represents
                the philosophical north star for maximalists.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The path to decentralization is iterative. Shared
                sequencers and proof aggregation markets represent
                near-term milestones. Enshrined ZK-EVMs embody the
                distant ideal. Type-2 ZK-EVMs serve as the crucial
                proving ground for the technologies and governance

                entry – from the conceptual genesis rooted in the
                Scalability Trilemma, through the arduous historical
                development marked by cryptographic breakthroughs and
                engineering marathons, into the intricate architecture
                balancing equivalence and efficiency, confronting the
                critical imperatives of security and decentralization,
                optimizing relentlessly against material constraints,
                witnessing explosive ecosystem adoption, and navigating

                core promise: <strong>Scalability</strong> (throughput
                of 100-1000+ TPS, fees cents), <strong>Security</strong>
                (inherited from Ethereum L1 via cryptographic validity
                proofs, eliminating fraud proof windows), while
                preserving <strong>Decentralization</strong> at the
                consensus level (relying on Ethereum) and making
                significant strides in decentralizing the operational
                layers (sequencing, proving). The trilemma is addressed
                not by compromise, but by cryptographic

                the frictionless migration of billions in DeFi TVL,
                ensured contract behavior remained identical to audited
                L1 deployments, and provided developers with a seamless,
                familiar environment. This fidelity, once considered a

                mathematical proofs of validity) represents a paradigm
                shift. Type-2 ZK-EVMs offer a qualitatively stronger
                security guarantee for scaled execution, a cornerstone
                for institutional adoption and high-value
                applications.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Catalyzing the Modular
                Ecosystem:</strong> The complexity of building ZK-EVMs
                spurred innovation in modular design (Polygon CDK, ZK
                Stack) and shared infrastructure (AggLayer, Bonsai
                Network). This modularity, rather than fragmentation,
                fosters a vibrant, interoperable ecosystem of
                specialized chains, accelerating overall
                innovation.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Economic Viability Secured:</strong> The
                confluence of EIP-4844 blobs (slashing DA costs),
                hardware acceleration (FPGAs/ASICs reducing proving
                costs), and efficient recursion/aggregation (minimizing
                verification gas) transformed the economics. User fees
                plummeted, making scalable Ethereum accessible to
                all.</p></li>

                <p><strong>Acknowledging the Journey and Challenges
                Ahead:</strong></p>
                <p>This triumph was neither swift nor easy. It was
                forged through years of persistent research (EF PSE,
                StarkWare, Matter Labs), audacious engineering (Scroll’s
                meticulous bytecode fidelity, Polygon’s zkASM
                evolution), collaborative spirit (shared libraries,
                open-source contributions), and navigating significant
                hurdles: the proving time bottleneck, the DA cost crisis
                pre-blobs, the sequencer/prover centralization dilemma,
                and the constant specter of Ethereum’s own evolution
                (Verkle, EOF).</p>
                <p>Challenges remain formidable. <strong>Decentralizing
                sequencers and provers</strong> at scale is an unsolved
                socio-technical puzzle. <strong>Adapting to Verkle Trees
                and EOF</strong> demands Herculean engineering efforts
                to maintain strict equivalence. <strong>Reducing proving
                latency</strong> to true real-time requires continued
                hardware and algorithmic leaps. <strong>Formally
                verifying</strong> these immensely complex systems is an
                ongoing marathon. <strong>Navigating regulatory
                landscapes</strong> around ZK technology presents
                uncertainties. The quest for <strong>“Type
                1-ness”</strong> through enshrinement is a distant,
                albeit inspiring, horizon.</p>
                <p><strong>Final Reflection: The Transformative
                Potential</strong></p>
                <p>Despite the challenges ahead, the significance of
                Type-2 ZK-EVMs cannot be overstated. They have
                successfully demonstrated that Ethereum’s vision of a
                decentralized world computer can scale to global
                capacity without sacrificing its core security or
                developer-centric values. They have moved blockchain
                scaling from the realm of optimistic promises and
                fragmented sidechains to the foundation of cryptographic
                certainty and seamless compatibility.</p>
                <p>Beyond Ethereum, they serve as a powerful
                proof-of-concept for a broader future. They illustrate
                how verifiable computation, powered by zero-knowledge
                cryptography, can transcend blockchain, offering tools
                to build a more trustworthy, efficient, and private
                digital infrastructure for the entire internet. The
                ability to prove anything about data or computation,
                without revealing secrets, is a fundamental shift in how
                we establish trust online.</p>
                <p>The story of Type-2 ZK-EVMs is not one of finality,
                but of a critical threshold crossed. They have
                transformed Ethereum scaling from a desperate imperative
                into a practical, secure, and thriving reality. They
                stand as a testament to human ingenuity and
                collaborative effort, proving that even the most
                daunting cryptographic and engineering challenges can be
                overcome. As research pushes performance to new heights,
                decentralization expands its reach, and applications
                beyond imagination emerge, one truth is evident: the
                scalable, secure Ethereum dream is no longer a dream. It
                is being built, proven, and utilized, one zero-knowledge
                proof at a time. The foundation for the next era of the
                internet is here.</p>
